While we developed PadChest-GR to help train and validate our own models, we believe the research community will greatly benefit from this dataset for many years to come. We look forward to seeing the broader research community build on this—improving grounded reporting AI models and using PadChest-GR as a standard for evaluation.

            "What is DFT?": "Molecules and materials are made of atoms, which are held together by their electrons. These electrons act as a glue, determining the stability and properties of the chemical structure. Accurately computing the strength and properties of the electron glue is essential for predicting whether a chemical reaction will proceed, whether a candidate drug molecule will bind to its target protein, whether a material is suitable for carbon capture, or if a flow battery can be optimized for renewable energy storage. Unfortunately, a brute-force approach amounts to solving the many-electron Schrödinger equation, which requires computation that scales exponentially with the number of electrons. Considering that an atom has dozens of electrons, and that molecules and materials have large numbers of atoms, we could easily end up waiting the age of the universe to complete our computation unless we restrict our attention to small systems with only a few atoms.",
            "What is the grand challenge in DFT?": "But there is a catch: the exact reformulation has a small but crucial term—the exchange-correlation (XC) functional—which Kohn proved is universal (i.e., the same for all molecules and materials), but for which no explicit expression is known. For 60 years, people have designed practical approximations for the XC functional. The magazine Science dubbed the gold rush to design better XC models the “pursuit of the Divine Functional\n(opens in new tab)\n”. With time, these approximations have grown into a zoo of hundreds of different XC functionals from which users must choose, often using experimental data as a guide. Owing to the uniquely favorable computational cost of DFT, existing functionals have enabled scientists to gain extremely useful insight into a huge variety of chemical problems. However, the limited accuracy and scope of current XC functionals mean that DFT is still mostly used to interpret experimental results rather than predict them.",
            "Why is it important to increase the accuracy of DFT?": "We can contrast the present state of computational chemistry with the state of aircraft engineering and design. Thanks to predictive simulations, aeronautical engineers no longer need to build and test thousands of prototypes to identify one viable design. However, this is exactly what we currently must do in molecular and materials sciences. We send thousands of potential candidates to the lab, because the accuracy of the computational methods is not sufficient to predict the experiments. To make a significant shift in the balance from laboratory to in silico experiments, we need to remove the fundamental bottleneck of the insufficient accuracy of present XC functionals. This amounts to bringing the error of DFT calculations with respect to experiments within chemical accuracy, which is around 1 kcal/mol for most chemical processes. Present approximations typically have errors that are 3 to 30 times larger.",
            "How can AI make a difference?": "AI can transform how we model molecules and materials with DFT by learning the XC functional directly from highly accurate data. The goal is to learn how the XC functional captures the complex relationship between its input, the electron density, and its output, the XC energy. You can think of the density like a glue, with regions of space where there is a lot of it and other regions with less of it. Traditionally, researchers have built XC functional approximations using the concept of the so-called Jacob’s ladder: a hierarchy of increasingly complex, hand-designed descriptors of the electron density. Including density descriptors from higher rungs of this ladder aims to improve accuracy, but it comes at the price of increased computational cost. Even the few attempts that use machine learning have stayed within this traditional paradigm, thereby taking an approach that is akin to what people were doing in computer vision and speech recognition before the deep-learning era. Progress toward better accuracy has stagnated for at least two decades with this approach.",
            "What have we done in this milestone?": "The first step was generating data—a lot of it. This posed a major challenge, since the data must come from accurate solutions of the many-electron Schrödinger equation, which is precisely the prohibitively expensive problem that DFT is designed to replace. Fortunately, decades of progress in the scientific community have led to smarter, more efficient variants of brute-force methods, making it possible to compute reference data for small molecules at experimental accuracy. While these high-accuracy methods, also referred to as wavefunction methods, are far too costly for routine use in applications, we made a deliberate investment in them for this project. The reason? The upfront cost of generating high-quality training data is offset by the long-term benefit of enabling vast numbers of industrially relevant applications with cost effective DFT using the trained XC functional. Crucially, we rely on the ability of DFT—and our learned XC functional—to generalize from high-accuracy data for small systems to larger, more complex molecules.",
            "Advancing computational chemistry together": "We are excited to work closely with the global computational chemistry community to accelerate progress for all and look forward to openly releasing our first XC functional in the near future.",

Cryptosystems like RSA, Diffie-Hellman key-exchange, and elliptic curve-based schemes—which rely on the hardness of the integer factorization and (elliptic curve) discrete logarithm problems—secure communications on the internet, banking transactions, and even national security systems. However, the emergence of quantum computing poses a significant threat to these cryptographic schemes.",
            "The NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization effort": "In 2017, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) launched the Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization project\n(opens in new tab)\n to evaluate and select cryptographic algorithms capable of withstanding quantum attacks. As part of this initiative, NIST sought proposals for two types of cryptographic primitives: key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs)—which enable two parties to securely derive a shared key to establish an encrypted connection, similar to traditional key exchange schemes—and digital signature schemes.",
            "International standardization of post-quantum cryptography": "Beyond NIST, other international standardization bodies have been actively working on quantum-resistant cryptographic solutions. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is leading a global effort to standardize additional PQC algorithms. Notably, European government agencies—including Germany’s BSI\n(opens in new tab)\n, the Netherlands’ NLNCSA and AIVD\n(opens in new tab)\n, and France’s ANSSI\n(opens in new tab)\n—have shown strong support for FrodoKEM, recognizing it as a conservative alternative to structured lattice-based schemes.",
            "What is FrodoKEM?": "FrodoKEM is a key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) based on the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem, a cornerstone of lattice-based cryptography. Unlike structured lattice-based schemes such as ML-KEM, FrodoKEM is built on generic, unstructured lattices, i.e., it is based on the plain LWE problem.",
            "Lattices and the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem": "Lattice-based cryptography relies on the mathematical structure of lattices, which are regular arrangements of points in multidimensional space. A lattice is defined as the set of all integer linear combinations of a set of basis vectors. The difficulty of certain computational problems on lattices, such as the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) and the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem, forms the basis of lattice-based schemes.",
            "How FrodoKEM Works": "FrodoKEM follows the standard paradigm of a KEM, which consists of three main operations—key generation, encapsulation, and decapsulation—performed interactively between a sender and a recipient with the goal of establishing a shared secret key:",
            "Performance: Strong security has a cost": "Not relying on additional algebraic structure certainly comes at a cost for FrodoKEM in the form of increased protocol runtime and bandwidth. The table below compares the performance and key sizes corresponding to the FrodoKEM level 1 parameter set (variant called “FrodoKEM-640-AES”) and the respective parameter set of ML-KEM (variant called “ML-KEM-512”). These parameter sets are intended to match or exceed the brute force security of AES-128. As can be seen, the difference in speed and key sizes between FrodoKEM and ML-KEM is more than an order of magnitude. Nevertheless, the runtime of the FrodoKEM protocol remains reasonable for most applications. For example, on our benchmarking platform clocked at 3.2GHz, the measured runtimes are 0.97 ms, 1.9 ms, and 3.2 ms for security levels 1, 2, and 3, respectively.",
            "A holistic design made with security in mind": "FrodoKEM’s design principles support security beyond its reliance on generic, unstructured lattices to minimize the attack surface of potential future cryptanalytic threats. Its parameters have been carefully chosen with additional security margins to withstand advancements in known attacks. Furthermore, FrodoKEM is designed with simplicity in mind—its internal operations are based on straightforward matrix-vector arithmetic using integer coefficients reduced modulo a power of two. These design decisions facilitate simple, compact and secure implementations that are also easier to maintain and to protect against side-channel attacks.",
            "Conclusion": "After years of research and analysis, the next generation of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms has arrived. NIST has chosen strong PQC protocols that we believe will serve Microsoft and its customers well in many applications. For security-sensitive applications, FrodoKEM offers a secure yet practical approach for post-quantum cryptography. While its reliance on unstructured lattices results in larger key sizes and higher computational overhead compared to structured lattice-based alternatives, it provides strong security assurances against potential future attacks. Given the ongoing standardization efforts and its endorsement by multiple governmental agencies, FrodoKEM is well-positioned as a viable alternative for organizations seeking long-term cryptographic resilience in a post-quantum world.",
            "Further Reading": "For those interested in learning more about FrodoKEM, post-quantum cryptography, and lattice-based cryptography, the following resources provide valuable insights:"

            "How is Magentic-UI human-centered?": "While many web agents promise full autonomy, in practice users can be left unsure of what the agent can do, what it is currently doing, and whether they have enough control to intervene when something goes wrong or doesn’t occur as expected. By contrast, Magentic-UI considers user needs at every stage of interaction. We followed a human-centered design methodology in building Magentic-UI by prototyping and obtaining feedback from pilot users during its design.",
            "Architecture": "Magentic-UI’s underlying system is a team of specialized agents adapted from AutoGen’s Magentic-One system. The agents work together to create a modular system:",
            "Evaluating Magentic-UI": "Magentic-UI innovates through its ability to integrate human feedback in its planning and execution of tasks. We performed a preliminary automated evaluation to showcase this ability on the GAIA benchmark\n(opens in new tab)\n for agents with a user-simulation experiment.",
            "Learning and reusing plans": "As described above, once Magentic-UI completes a task, users have the option for Magentic-UI to learn a plan based on the execution of the task. These plans are saved in a plan gallery, which users and Magentic-UI can access in the future.",
            "Safety and control": "Magentic-UI can surf the live internet and execute code. With such capabilities, we need to ensure that Magentic-UI acts in a safe and secure manner. The following features, design decisions, and evaluations were made to ensure this:",
            "Open research questions": "Magentic-UI provides a tool for researchers to study critical questions in agentic systems and particularly on human-agent interaction. In a previous report\n(opens in new tab)\n, we outlined 12 questions for human-agent communication, and Magentic-UI provides a vehicle to study these questions in a realistic setting. A key question among these is how we enable humans to efficiently intervene and provide feedback to the agent while executing a task. Humans should not have to constantly watch the agent. Ideally, the agent should know when to reach out for help and provide the necessary context for the human to assist it. A second question is about safety. As agents interact with the live web, they may become prone to attacks from malicious actors. We need to study what necessary safeguards are needed to protect the human from side effects without adding a heavy burden on the human to verify every agent action. There are also many other questions surrounding security, personalization, and learning that Magentic-UI can help with studying.",
            "Conclusion": "Magentic-UI is an open-source agent prototype that works with people to complete complex tasks that require multi-step planning and browser use. As agentic systems expand in the scope of tasks they can complete, Magentic-UI’s design enables better transparency into agent actions and enables human control to ensure safety and reliability. Moreover, by facilitating human intervention, we can improve performance while still reducing human cost in completing tasks on aggregate. Today we have released the first version of Magentic-UI. Looking ahead, we plan to continue developing it in the open with the goal of improving its capabilities and answering research questions on human-agent collaboration. We invite the research community to extend and reuse Magentic-UI for their scientific explorations and domains."

This difficulty rating is based on a detailed rubric, originally developed for human tasks and shown to work reliably when applied by AI models.",
            "Evaluation results": "Using ADeLe, the team evaluated 20 popular AI benchmarks and uncovered three key findings: 1) Current AI benchmarks have measurement limitations; 2) AI models show distinct patterns of strengths and weaknesses across different capabilities; and 3) ADeLe provides accurate predictions of whether AI systems will succeed or fail on a new task.",

            "Introducing debug-gym": "A natural research question emerges: to what degree can LLMs use interactive debugging tools such as pdb? To explore this question, we released debug-gym\n(opens in new tab)\n – an environment that allows code-repairing agents to access tools for active information-seeking behavior. Debug-gym expands an agent’s action and observation space with feedback from tool usage, enabling setting breakpoints, navigating code, printing variable values, and creating test functions. Agents can interact with tools to investigate code or rewrite it, if confident. We believe interactive debugging with proper tools can empower coding agents to tackle real-world software engineering tasks and is central to LLM-based agent research. The fixes proposed by a coding agent with debugging capabilities, and then approved by a human programmer, will be grounded in the context of the relevant codebase, program execution and documentation, rather than relying solely on guesses based on previously seen training data.",
            "Early experimentation: promising signal": "For our initial attempt to validate that LLMs perform better on coding tests when they have access to debugging tools, we built a simple prompt-based agent and provided it with access to the following debug tools: eval, view, pdb, rewrite, and listdir. We used nine different LLMs as the backbone for our agent. Detailed results can be found in the technical report\n(opens in new tab)\n.\n(opens in new tab)",
            "Future work": "We believe that training or fine-tuning LLMs can enhance their interactive debugging abilities. This requires specialized data, such as trajectory data that records agents interacting with a debugger to gather information before suggesting a fix. Unlike conventional reasoning problems, interactive debugging involves generating actions at each step that trigger feedback from the environment. This feedback helps the agent make new decisions, requiring dense data like the problem description and the sequence of actions leading to the solution.",
            "Acknowledgements": "We thank Ruoyao Wang for their insightful discussion on building interactive debugging agents, Chris Templeman and Elaina Maffeo for their team coaching, Jessica Mastronardi and Rich Ciapala for their kind support in project management and resource allocation, and Peter Jansen for providing valuable feedback for the technical report."

            "Architecture": "The VidTok framework builds on a classic 3D encoder-decoder structure but introduces 2D and 1D processing techniques to handle spatial and temporal information more efficiently. Because 3D architectures are computationally intensive, VidTok combines them with less resource-intensive 2D and 1D methods to reduce computational costs while maintaining video quality.",
            "Quantization": "To efficiently compress video data, AI systems often use quantization to reduce the amount of information that needs to be stored or transmitted. A traditional method for doing this is vector quantization (VQ), which groups values together and matches them to a fixed set of patterns (known as a codebook). However, this can lead to an inefficient use of patterns and lower video quality.",
            "Training": "Training video tokenizers requires significant computing power. VidTok uses a two-stage process:",
            "Evaluating VidTok": "VidTok’s performance evaluation using the MCL-JCV benchmark—a comprehensive video quality assessment dataset—and an internal dataset demonstrates its superiority over existing state-of-the-art models in video tokenization. The assessment, which covered approximately 5,000 videos of various types, employed four standard metrics to measure video quality:",
            "Looking ahead": "VidTok represents a significant development in video tokenization and processing. Its innovative architecture and training approach enable improved performance across various video quality metrics, making it a valuable tool for video analysis and compression tasks. Its capacity to model complex visual dynamics could improve the efficiency of video systems by enabling AI processing on more compact units rather than raw pixels."

            "Results": "In our paper, we demonstrate that Claimify outperforms existing LLM-based methods[3]. Specifically, we show that: (1) 99% of claims extracted by Claimify are entailed by their source sentence, (2) Claimify strikes the best balance between including verifiable content and excluding unverifiable content, and (3) Claimify is least likely to omit context critical to the fact-checking verdict.",
            "Next steps": "We’re currently working on new methods for evaluating LLM-generated texts. We anticipate that the high-quality claims extracted by Claimify will help not only in verifying the veracity of LLM outputs, but also in assessing their overall quality – especially when gold-standard references are difficult to create (e.g., long-form texts where people may disagree on what defines “good” content). For example, we recently used Claimify to evaluate the comprehensiveness and diversity of answers generated by GraphRAG, showing that GraphRAG outperforms traditional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in these areas."

            "A new way to integrate knowledge": "To address these challenges, we introduce the Knowledge Base-Augmented Language Model (KBLaM) —a novel approach that integrates structured knowledge bases into pre-trained LLMs. Instead of relying on external retrieval modules or costly fine-tuning, KBLaM encodes knowledge into continuous key-value vector pairs, efficiently embedding them within the model’s attention layers using a specialized rectangular attention mechanism, which implicitly performs retrieval in an integrated manner.",
            "Scalable, efficient, and future-ready": "At its core, KBLaM is designed to integrate structured knowledge into LLMs, making them more efficient and scalable. It achieves this by converting external knowledge bases—collections of facts structured as triples consisting of an entity, a property, and a value—into a format that LLMs can process naturally.  Such knowledge bases allow for consolidated, reliable sources of knowledge.",
            "Enhancing interpretability and reliability": "Another major benefit of KBLaM is its interpretability. Unlike in-context learning, where knowledge injection is opaque, KBLAM’s attention weights provide clear insights into how the model utilizes knowledge tokens. Experiments show that KBLaM assigns high attention scores to relevant knowledge triples, effectively mimicking a soft retrieval process.",
            "The future of knowledge-augmented AI": "KBLaM represents a major step forward in integrating structured knowledge into LLMs. By offering a scalable, efficient, and interpretable alternative to existing techniques, it paves the way for AI systems that can stay up to date and provide reliable, knowledge-driven responses. In fields where accuracy and trust are critical—such as medicine, finance, and scientific research—this approach has the potential to transform how language models interact with real-world information."

            "Topics": "To get a clear picture of how people are using Copilot in Bing, we need to first classify sessions into topical categories. To do this, we developed a topic classifier. We used the LLM classification approach described above to label the primary topic (domain) for the entire content of the chat. Although a single chat can cover multiple topics, for this analysis, we generated a single label for the primary topic of the conversation. We sampled five million anonymized Copilot in Bing chats during August and September 2024, and found that globally, 21% of all chats were about technology, with a high concentration of these chats in programming and scripting and computers and electronics.",
            "Search versus Copilot": "Beyond analyzing topics, we compared Copilot in Bing usage to that of traditional search. Chat extends beyond traditional online search by enabling users to summarize, generate, compare, and analyze information. Human-AI interactions are conversational and more complex than traditional search (Figure 6).",
            "Conclusion": "LLMs have enabled a new era of high-quality human-AI interaction, and with it, the capability to analyze those same interactions with high fidelity, at scale, and in near real-time. We are now able to obtain actionable insight from complex data that is not possible with traditional data science pattern-matching methods. LLM-generated classifications are pushing research into new directions that will ultimately improve user experience and satisfaction when using chat and other user-AI interaction tools."

            "Introduction": "Modern biomedical research is driven by the promise of precision medicine—tailored treatments for individual patients through the integration of diverse, large-scale datasets. Yet, the journey from raw data to actionable insights is fraught with challenges. Our team of researchers at Microsoft Research in the Health Futures group, in collaboration with the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania\n(opens in new tab)\n, conducted an in-depth exploration of these challenges in a study published in Nature Scientific Reports. The goal of this research was to identify pain points in the biomedical data lifecycle and offer actionable recommendations to enable secure data-sharing, improved interoperability, robust analysis, and foster collaboration across the biomedical research community.",
            "Study at a glance": "A deep understanding of the biomedical discovery process is crucial for advancing modern precision medicine initiatives. To explore this, our study involved in-depth, semi-structured interviews with biomedical research professionals spanning various roles including bench scientists, computational biologists, researchers, clinicians, and data curators. Participants provided detailed insights into their workflows, from data acquisition and curation to analysis and result dissemination. We used an inductive-deductive thematic analysis to identify key challenges occurring at each stage of the data lifecycle—from raw data collection to the communication of data-driven findings.",
            "Looking ahead": "At Microsoft Research, we believe in the power of interdisciplinarity and innovation. This study not only identifies the critical pain points that have slowed biomedical discovery but also illustrates a clear path toward improved data integrity, interoperability, and collaboration. By uniting diverse stakeholders around a common, secure, and scalable data research lifecycle, we edge closer to realizing individualized therapeutics for every patient."

I had recently returned from maternity leave, and while I was away the machine learning world had changed in fundamental ways. ChatGPT had been publicly released, and those who had tried it were in awe of OpenAI’s technical achievements and the model’s capabilities. It was a powerful demonstration of what transformer-based generative models could do when trained on large amounts of (text) data. Coming back from leave at that moment, the key question on my mind was, “What are the implications of this achievement for our team’s work at the intersection of artificial intelligence and video games?”",
            "What motivated this research?": "As we release our research insights and model today, I keep thinking back to how this all started.  There was a key moment back in December 2022 that I remember clearly.

Coming back from leave at that moment, the key question on my mind was, “What are the implications of this achievement for our team’s work at the intersection of artificial intelligence and video games?”",
            "A new research opportunity enabled by data": "In our team, we had access to a very different source of data. For years, we had collaborated with Xbox Game Studios’ Ninja Theory (based in Cambridge, UK, just like our research team) to collect gameplay data from Bleeding Edge, their 2020 Xbox game. Bleeding Edge is a 4-versus-4 game where all games are played online, and matches are recorded if the player agrees to the End User License Agreement (EULA). We worked closely with our colleagues at Ninja Theory and with Microsoft compliance teams to ensure that the data was collected ethically and used responsibly for research purposes.",
            "Scaling up model training": "As the team got to work, some of the key challenges included scaling up the model training. We initially used a V100 cluster, where we were able to prove out how to scale up to training on up to 100 GPUs; that eventually paved the way to training at scale on H100s. Key design decisions we made early focused on how to best leverage insights from the large language model (LLM) community and included choices such as how to effectively represent controller actions and especially images.",
            "Multidisciplinary collaboration: Involving users from the beginning": "We had started to investigate how to evaluate these types of models early on. For example, we wanted to understand the representations learned using linear probing, which was driven by Research Intern Gunshi Gupta and Senior Research Scientist Sergio Valcarcel Macua; to explore online evaluation, driven by Senior Research Scientist Raluca Georgescu; and to generate both visuals and actions, initially termed “full dreaming” and driven by Research Intern Tarun Gupta. But working through how to systematically evaluate Muse required a much broader set of insights. More importantly, we needed to understand how people might use these models in order to know how to evaluate them.",
            "Unlocking new creative use cases with the WHAM Demonstrator": "Now, with the model’s emerging capabilities and user insights in mind, it was time to put all the pieces together. The teams joined forces during a Microsoft internal hackathon to explore new interaction paradigms and creative uses that Muse could unlock. As a result, we developed a prototype that we call the WHAM Demonstrator, which allows users to directly interface with the model.",
            "Identifying key capabilities and how to evaluate them": "The hands-on experience of exploring Muse capabilities with the WHAM Demonstrator, and drawing on insights we gained from the user study, allowed us to systematically identify capabilities that game creatives would require to use generative models like Muse. This in turn allowed us to establish evaluation protocols for three key capabilities: consistency, diversity, and persistency. Consistency refers to a model’s ability to generate gameplay sequences that respect the dynamics of the game. For example, the character moves consistently with controller actions, does not walk through walls, and generally reflects the physics of the underlying game. Diversity refers to a model’s ability to generate a range of gameplay variants given the same initial prompt, covering a wide range of ways in which gameplay could evolve. Finally, persistency refers to a model’s ability to incorporate (or “persist”) user modifications into generated gameplay sequences, such as a character that is copy-pasted into a game visual. We give an overview of these capabilities below.",
            "Muse evaluation of consistency, diversity and persistency": "With our evaluation framework in place, and access to an H100 compute allocation, the team was able to further improve Muse instances, including higher resolution image encoders (our current models generate visuals at a resolution of 300×180 pixels, up from the 128×128 resolution of our earliest models) and larger models, and expand to all seven Bleeding Edge maps. To show some of the capabilities of the model we are publishing today, we have included videos of 2-minute-long generated gameplay sequences above, which give an impression of the consistency and diversity of gameplay sequences that the model can generate.",
            "Conclusion": "Today, our team is excited to be publishing our work in Nature and simultaneously releasing Muse open weights, the WHAM Demonstrator, and sample data to the community."

It leverages Physics Wallah’s rich repository of high-quality curated content—developed and refined over several years—along with continuous updates from subject matter experts to ensure new materials, textbooks, tutorials, and question banks are seamlessly incorporated. Despite considerable progress, the existing AI sometimes falters when navigating complex academic problems.",
            "Opening new doors for students": "Getting an education at a top university can be life changing for anyone. For Chandramouleswar Parida, it could change the lives of everyone in his home village in Baniatangi, Khordha, Odisha State, India. Chandra decided to become a doctor after watching his grandfather die from a heart attack. The nearest doctor who could have treated him was at a regional hospital 65 kilometers away.",

In contrast to Imitation Learning, which centers on training models using the optimal actions identified through search, Exploratory Learning focuses on cultivating the agent’s ability to navigate its environment by teaching it to evaluate states, explore different pathways, and efficiently backtrack from unpromising paths to identify more favorable alternatives.",
            "Continued exploration": "Advancing autonomous AI agents is key to enabling them to handle complex, multi-step tasks with greater precision and adaptability. ExACT represents a significant step toward creating agents that can perform complex decision-making before taking action, leading to improved performance, but challenges remain. How can AI agents improve decision-making in real-world scenarios, where they may be constrained by time or resources? How can they learn effectively and efficiently from environmental feedback? We are currently investigating these questions, and we invite you to explore them with us by building on the ExACT framework. Access the ExACT code at our GitHub repository\n(opens in new tab)\n."

            "A novel diffusion architecture": "MatterGen is a diffusion model that operates on the 3D geometry of materials. Much like an image diffusion model generates pictures from a text prompt by modifying the color of pixels from a noisy image, MatterGen generates proposed structures by adjusting the positions, elements, and periodic lattice from a random structure. The diffusion architecture is specifically designed for materials to handle specialties like periodicity and 3D geometry.",
            "Outperforming screening": "The key advantage of MatterGen over screening is its ability to access the full space of unknown materials. In Figure 4, we show that MatterGen continues to generate more novel candidate materials with high bulk modulus above 400 GPa, for example, which are hard to compress. In contrast, screening baseline saturates due to exhausting known candidates.",
            "Handling compositional disorder": "Compositional disorder (Figure 5) is a commonly observed phenomenon where different atoms can randomly swap their crystallographic sites in a synthesized material. Recently\n(opens in new tab)\n, the community has been exploring what it means for a material to be novel in the context of computationally designed materials, as widely employed algorithms will not distinguish between pairs of structures where the only difference is a permutation of similar elements in their respective sites.",
            "Experimental lab verification": "In addition to our extensive computational evaluation, we have validated MatterGen’s capabilities through experimental synthesis. In collaboration with the team led by Prof Li Wenjie from the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology\n(opens in new tab)\n (SIAT) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, we have synthesized a novel material, TaCr2O6, whose structure was generated by MatterGen after conditioning the model on a bulk modulus value of 200 GPa. The synthesized material’s structure aligns with the one proposed by MatterGen, with the caveat of compositional disorder between Ta and Cr. Additionally, we experimentally measure a bulk modulus of 169 GPa against the 200 GPa given as design specification, with a relative error below 20%, very close from an experimental perspective. If similar results can be translated to other domains, it will have a profound impact on the design of batteries, fuel cells, and more.",
            "AI emulator and generator flywheel": "MatterGen presents a new opportunity for AI accelerated materials design, complementing our AI emulator MatterSim. MatterSim follows the fifth paradigm of scientific discovery, significantly accelerating the speed of material properties’ simulations. MatterGen in turn accelerates the speed of exploring new material candidates with property guided generation. MatterGen and MatterSim can work together as a flywheel to speed up both the simulation and exploration of novel materials.",
            "Making MatterGen available": "We believe the best way to make an impact in materials design is to make our model available to the public. We release the source code of MatterGen\n(opens in new tab)\n under the MIT license, together with the training and fine-tuning data. We welcome the community to use and build on top of our model.",
            "Looking ahead": "MatterGen represents a new paradigm of materials design enabled by generative AI technology. It explores a significantly larger space of materials than screening-based methods. It is also more efficient by guiding materials exploration with prompts. Similar to how generative AI has impacted drug discovery\n(opens in new tab)\n, it will have profound impact on how we design materials in broad domains including batteries, magnets, and fuel cells.",

It provides several interfaces for other system parts to integrate and extend. First, it establishes a session with an agent to share information about benchmark problems: (1) the problem description, (2) instructions (e.g., response format), and (3) available APIs to call as actions.",
            "Service": "AIOpsLab abstracts a diverse set of services to reflect the variance in production environments. This includes live, running services that are implemented using various architectural principles, including microservices, serverless, and monolithic.",
            "Workload generator": "The workload generator in AIOpsLab plays a crucial role by creating simulations of both faulty and normal scenarios. It receives specifications from the orchestrator, such as the task, desired effects, scale, and duration. The generator can use a model trained on real production traces to generate workloads that align with these specifications. Faulty scenarios may simulate conditions like resource exhaustion, exploit edge cases, or trigger cascading failures, inspired by real incidents. Normal scenarios mimic typical production patterns, such as daily activity cycles and multi-user interactions. When various characteristics (e.g., service calls, user distribution, arrival times) can lead to the desired effect, multiple workloads can be stored in the problem cache for use by the orchestrator. In coordination with the fault generator, the workload generator can also create complex fault scenarios with workloads.",
            "Fault generator": "AIOpsLab has a novel push-button fault generator designed for generic applicability across various cloud scenarios. Our approach integrates application and domain knowledge to create adaptable policies and “oracles” compatible with AIOps scenarios. This includes fine-grained fault injection capable of simulating complex failures inspired by production incidents. Additionally, it can inject faults at various system levels, exposing root causes while maintaining semantic integrity and considering interdependencies between cloud microservices. The fault injector’s versatility can enhance the reliability and robustness of cloud systems by enabling thorough testing and evaluation of AIOps capabilities.",
            "Observability": "AIOpsLab is equipped with an extensible observability layer designed to provide comprehensive monitoring capabilities across various system layers for any AIOps tool. AIOpsLab collects a wide array of telemetry data, including (1) traces from Jaeger detailing the end-to-end paths of requests through distributed systems, (2) application logs formatted and recorded by Filebeat and Logstash, and (3) system metrics monitored by Prometheus. Additionally, AIOpsLab also captures lower-level system information such as syscall logs and cluster information. As mentioned, we handle potential data overload through flexible APIs to tune the telemetry data relevant to the AIOps tools.",
            "Next steps": "This research project adopts Microsoft security standards and Responsible AI principles, and we envision this research evolving into a vital resource for organizations aiming to optimize their IT operations. Additionally, we plan to collaborate with various generative AI teams to incorporate AIOpsLab as a benchmark scenario for evaluating state-of-the-art models. By doing so, we aim to foster innovation and encourage the development of more advanced AIOps solutions. This research is essential not only for IT professionals but also for anyone invested in the future of technology, as it has the potential to redefine how organizations manage operations, respond to incidents, and ultimately serve their customers in an increasingly automated world.",

These innovations have the potential to empower financial researchers to customize generative models for diverse scenarios, establishing a new paradigm for applying generative models to downstream tasks in financial markets. This integration may provide enhanced efficiency, more accurate insights, and significant advancements in the financial domain.",

            "Is o1-preview “just” fancy prompting?": "The introduction of the OpenAI o1 model series marks a significant shift from prior GPT models. Unlike GPT, o1 models are trained using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques that enable them to “think” before generating outputs. While Medprompt relies on a cascade of operations with GPT-4 at run time guided by a multistage prompt, the o1 series incorporates this run-time reasoning directly into its RL-based design. The built-in functionality enables the o1 models to significantly outperform even the best results using GPT-4 and Medprompt. The performance gains come with a notable tradeoff: its per-token cost was approximately six times that of GPT-4o at the time of our evaluation. While the results for GPT-4o with Medprompt fall short of o1-preview model performance, the combination offers a more cost-effective alternative. The cost-benefit tradeoffs are highlighted in the following figure, with the x-axis presented on a logarithmic scale.",
            "Can we prompt engineer o1-preview?": "The o1-preview model exhibits distinct run-time behaviors compared to the GPT series. While some of our more dynamic prompting strategies performed better than expected with o1-preview models, our most tried-and-true strategy was anything but consistent throughout our evaluation. Figure 4 captures specific performance results for Tailored Prompt, Ensembling, and Few-Shot Prompting on o1-preview. Here’s a summary of our findings:",
            "Do results stand in another language?": "We expanded our research to include a new multilingual benchmark based on the Japanese national medical licensing exam. The JMLE (Japanese Medical Licensing Examination) is written in Japanese and administered in February 2024, after the o1-preview model’s knowledge cutoff. Even without translation to English, the o1-preview model achieved a remarkable score of 98.2% accuracy (Figure 5), well above the exam’s minimum passing score of approximately 80%.",
            "Do reasoning tokens improve performance?": "For fun, we conducted tests to determine whether increasing the number of reasoning tokens could improve performance. Our findings showed that by adjusting the prompt, we were able to consistently increase the number of reasoning tokens used by o1-preview, and the increase was directly correlated with improved performance as demonstrated in Figure 6.",
            "What’s the takeaway?": "Bottom line: There’s a little something for everyone when it comes to run-time strategies. We’re excited by the performance gains from GPT models to o1-preview models. While these improvements are significant, so is the cost. For those needing proven accuracy on a budget, Medprompt leveraging calls to GPT-4 is a viable option for medicine and beyond. We summarize the relative performance of prompting strategies in Figure 7 to determine the best option, or check out the paper for a detailed breakdown of every dataset, experimental configuration, and prompt template\n(opens in new tab)\n.",

TamGen offers a new approach to drug discovery by applying the principles of generative AI to molecular design. Unlike traditional methods, which depend on systematically screening known compounds—a process that is long, complex, and costly due to its reliance on empirical knowledge and the time-consuming task of exploring a vast chemical library—generative AI provides opportunities for designing entirely new chemical structures.",
            "TamGen workflow": "TamGen’s workflow uses generative AI to design target-specific chemical compounds. Building on the success of large language models (LLMs), we adapted a similar approach for molecular generation, using a training method like that of GPT models, which involves next-token prediction. Molecules were first converted into a simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES)—a notation representing molecular structures as symbol sequences, similar to text. We then developed a protein encoder to process information about proteins, including their 3D structure.",
            "Evaluating TamGen computationally": "To evaluate TamGen’s performance, we compared it to five other common methods used to create 3D shapes of molecules intended to bind to certain proteins. We evaluated these methods using the CrossDocked benchmark, a dataset used in AI research to assess the quality of molecule generation conditioned on a target protein.",
            "Experimental lab verification": "To ensure real-world applicability, we also validated our findings in a hands-on lab environment. Here, we focused on the ClpP protease in Mycobacterium tuberculosis as the target because it plays a significant role in the bacterium’s survival under stress conditions. We proposed the Design-Refine-Test pipeline to effectively identify molecular compounds for TB drug discovery.",
            "From molecule to fragment generation": "In addition to generating new molecules, TamGen can optimize existing ones by designing smaller molecular fragments. In this fragment generation process, TamGen builds on a given protein target and a molecular core structure to design new compounds around that core. By incorporating information about the target protein, it generates fragments that are highly specific to the target. This approach moves beyond traditional methods that rely on pre-existing databases, which often limit both novelty and effectiveness of molecular fragments.",
            "AI’s potential in drug discovery": "TamGen showcases the transformative potential of generative AI in drug design, combining advanced molecular modeling with researcher-AI collaboration. Tasks that once took years can now be accomplished in a fraction of the time. This research underscores AI’s expanding role in drug discovery and its promise for developing effective treatments against persistent infectious diseases like TB."

            "Image parsing: a unifying framework for holistic image analysis": "Back in 2005, researchers first introduced the concept of “image parsing”—a unified approach to image analysis that jointly conducts object recognition, detection, and segmentation. Built on Bayesian networks, this early model offered a glimpse into a future of joint learning and reasoning in image analysis, though it was limited in scope and application. Fast forward to today, cutting-edge advances in generative AI have breathed new life into this vision. With our model, BiomedParse, we have created a foundation for biomedical image parsing that leverages interdependencies across the three subtasks, thus addressing key limitations in traditional methods. BiomedParse enables users to simply input a natural-language description of an object, which the model uses to predict both the object label and its segmentation mask, thus eliminating the need for a bounding box (Figure 1c). In other words, this joint learning approach lets users segment objects based on text alone.",
            "Harnessing GPT-4 for large-scale data synthesis from existing datasets": "We created the first dataset for biomedical imaging parsing by harnessing GPT-4 for large-scale data synthesis from 45 existing biomedical segmentation datasets (Figure 1a and 1b). The key insight is to leverage readily available natural-language descriptions already in these datasets and use GPT-4 to organize this often messy, unstructured text with established biomedical object taxonomies.",
            "State-of-the-art performance across 64 major object types in 9 modalities": "We evaluated BiomedParse on a large held-out test set with 102,855 image-mask-label sets across 64 major object types in nine modalities. BiomedParse outperformed prior best methods such as MedSAM and SAM, even when oracle per-object bounding boxes were provided. In the more realistic setting when MedSAM and SAM used a state-of-the-art object detector (Grounding DINO) to propose bounding boxes, BiomedParse outperformed them by a wide margin, between 75 and 85 absolute points in dice score (Figure 2a). BiomedParse also outperforms a variety of other prominent methods such as SegVol, Swin UNETR, nnU-Net, DeepLab V3+, and UniverSeg.",
            "Recognizing and segmenting irregular and complex objects": "Biomedical objects often have complex and irregular shapes, which present significant challenges for segmentation, even with oracle bounding box. By joint learning with object recognition and detection, BiomedParse learns to model object-specific shapes, and its superiority is particularly pronounced for the most challenging cases (Figure 3). Encompassing a large collection of diverse object types in nine modalities, BiomedParseData also provides a much more realistic representation of object complexity in biomedicine.",
            "Promising step toward scaling holistic biomedical image analysis": "By operating through a simple text prompt, BiomedParse requires substantially less user effort than prior best methods that typically require object-specific bounding boxes, especially when an image contains a large number of objects (Figure 2c). By modeling object recognition threshold, BiomedParse can detect invalid prompt and reject segmentation requests when an object is absent from the image. BiomedParse can be used to recognize and segment all known objects in an image in one fell swoop (Figure 4). By scaling holistic image analysis, BiomedParse can potentially be applied to key precision health applications such as early detection, prognosis, treatment decision support, and progression monitoring."

            "Static vs. dynamic global search": "The global search\n(opens in new tab)\n algorithm in GraphRAG aims to answer abstract questions that require knowledge of the entire dataset. It generates answers by searching over communities at a predetermined level in the knowledge graph. Then the LLM combines and summarizes all the community reports at this level of abstraction. Finally, the summary is used as additional context for the LLM to generate the response to the user question. This map-reduce process allows the LLM to select relevant text from all the community reports to generate its final answer. This static approach is expensive and inefficient because it includes many lower-level reports that are not informative to the user query. Since it is unlikely that all community reports, especially at a high level, are relevant in answering the query, an approach that first considers the relevancy of the report prior to the resource-intensive map-reduce operation is highly desirable.",
            "Dynamic community selection on the AP News dataset": "To demonstrate the cost saving that dynamic global search brings while maintaining a similar response quality, we evaluated the two methods side by side on a dataset from AP News. We tested static and dynamic search on 50 global questions and assessed the final response quality using an LLM evaluator. Moreover, we compared the total token cost of the two methods. To compare the two methods directly, we constrained the maximum search depth on dynamic global search so that both methods used the same underlying information.",
            "Significant cost reduction while maintaining output quality": "The quality of responses generated from dynamic community selection are comparable to its static counterpart while reducing the total token cost. Our LLM evaluation shows that the output quality of the two methods is similar in the three key metrics across the 50 global questions on the AP News dataset, with no statistical significance between them. More importantly, we observed a significant reduction of total token costs when using the new method, with an average cost reduction of 77% over the existing static global search at community level 1. This is due to the large number of community reports being eliminated via the rating process, thus requiring fewer prompt and output tokens needed in the map-reduce operation. For instance, the existing static global search method processes about 1,500 level 1 community reports in the map-reduce operation, while only 470 community reports on average are selected in dynamic search to generate the final answer.",

Interest is growing in AI for IT Operations (AIOps), which aims to automate complex operational tasks like fault localization and root cause analysis, thereby reducing human intervention and customer impact.

This gives rise to so-called microarchitectural side-channel attacks where a malicious tenant can learn information about another tenant, in the worst case: their cryptographic keys.",

Our design provides what we call resource-exclusive domains, which extend the architectural abstraction of private physical threads and private memory to the microarchitectural level. That is, resource-exclusive domains guarantee isolation even against powerful attackers that try to mount side-channel attacks on shared microarchitectural resources.",
            "Co-designing cloud platforms for future microarchitectural isolation": "To validate the effectiveness and practicality of our approach, we inferred isolation schemes for a single CPU by reverse-engineering its microarchitecture. This approach is incomplete and does not scale to the diverse hardware fleet available in the cloud. We are working with CPU vendors to develop isolation schemes for future CPUs, which will then be exposed via the hardware interface for consumption by the hypervisor’s hardware abstraction layer. In this way, we will be able to reap the benefits of microarchitectural performance optimizations while continuing to provide strong security guarantees to cloud tenants."

            "Project phases": "Microsoft researchers, architects, and community partners held a participatory design session with state and utility representatives to define the project’s mission and key metrics. The CDC’s Social Vulnerability Index informed the site selection, supporting the project’s diversity, equity, and inclusion goals.",
            "AI: A path to equity and resilience": "The transition to decentralized microgrids offers new opportunities for energy efficiency, with AI playing a critical role in managing these systems. Yet additional efforts are needed for communities to fully realize these benefits. Residents of aging homes are burdened with outdated wiring, inefficient appliances, and poor insulation—factors that drive up energy costs. Their dependence on centralized grids offers little relief, underscoring the need for community-focused energy solutions.",

            "NEW RESEARCH": "Large vision-language models (VLMs) such as GPT-4V and GPT-4o show promise in driving intelligent agent systems that operate within user interfaces (UI). However, VLMs’ full potential remains underexplored in real-world applications, particularly when it comes to acting as general agents across diverse operating systems and applications with only vision input. One limiting factor is the absence of a robust technique for screen parsing which is capable of 1) reliably identifying interactable icons within the user interface, and 2) understanding the semantics of various elements in a screenshot and accurately associating the intended action with the corresponding region on the screen."

            "How GraphRAG works": "GraphRAG has two primary components, an indexing engine and a query engine.",
            "Introducing DRIFT Search": "DRIFT Search introduces a new approach to local search queries by including community information in the search process. This greatly expands the breadth of the query’s starting point and leads to retrieval and usage of a far higher variety of facts in the final answer. This addition expands the GraphRAG query engine by providing a more comprehensive option for local search, which uses community insights to refine a query into detailed follow-up questions. These follow-ups allow DRIFT to handle queries that may not fully align with the original extraction templates defined by the user at index time.",
            "DRIFT Search: A step-by-step process": "DRIFT search excels by dynamically combining global insights with local refinement, enabling navigation from high-level summaries down to original text chunks within the knowledge graph. This layered approach ensures that detailed, context-rich information is preserved even when the initial query diverges from the persona used during indexing. By decomposing broad questions into fine-grained follow-ups, DRIFT captures granular details and adjusts based on the emerging context, making it adaptable to diverse query types. This makes it particularly effective when handling queries that require both breadth and depth without losing specific details.",
            "Availability": "DRIFT search is available now on the GraphRAG GitHub\n(opens in new tab)\n.",
            "Future research directions": "A future version of DRIFT will incorporate an improved version of Global Search that will allow it to more directly address questions currently serviced best by global search. The hope is to then move towards a single query interface that can service questions of both local and global varieties. This work will further evolve DRIFT’s termination logic, potentially through a reward model that balances novel information with redundancy. Additionally, executing follow-up queries using either global or local search modes could improve efficiency. Some queries require broader data access, which can be achieved by leveraging a query router and a lite-global search variant that uses fewer community reports, tokens, and overall resources."

Cloud privacy, meanwhile, is important as a large number of container deployments operate on privacy-sensitive data, but challenging due to the increasing frequency and sophistication of attacks. State-of-the-art confidential container-based designs leverage process-based trusted execution environments (TEEs), but face security and compatibility issues that limit their practical deployment.",
            "Securely Training Decision Trees Efficiently": "In a recent paper: Securely Training Decision Trees Efficiently that will appear at ACM CCS 2024, researchers from Microsoft significantly reduce the communication complexity of secure decision tree training. Decision trees are an important class of supervised learning algorithms. In this approach, a classification or regression tree is built based on a set of features or attributes present in the training dataset. As with many learning algorithms, the accuracy of decision trees can be greatly improved with larger volumes of data. However, this can be a challenge, since data may come from multiple independent sources and require attention to data privacy concerns. In this case, the use of a privacy-enhancing technology, such as secure multi-party computation (MPC), can help protect the underlying training data.",
            "Multi-label audio classification with a noisy zero-shot teacher": "Improving the real-world accuracy of audio content detection (ACD) is an important problem for streaming platforms, operating systems and playback devices. It’s similar to audio tagging, i.e., labeling sounds present in a given audio segment of several seconds length or longer. However, ACD may consist of a small number of higher-level labels or super-classes, e.g. speech, music, traffic, machines, animals, etc., where each label can include a multitude of specific sounds.",

The UI features a pane called the “Concept Encoding Shelf,” where users can build their chart by dragging various data fields into it and defining them or by creating new ones. A large language model (LLM) on the backend processes this input, generating the necessary code to produce the visual and updating the data threads for future use. This process is illustrated in Figure 2.",
            "Data Formulator’s framework": "Data Formulator’s architecture separates data transformation from chart configuration, improving both the user experience and AI performance. Upon receiving user specifications, the system follows a three-step process: (1) it generates a Vega-Lite script, which defines how data is visualized; (2) it instructs the AI to handle data transformation; and (3) it creates the chart using the converted data, as illustrated in Figure 4.",
            "Implications and looking forward": "Refining how users interact with AI-powered tools is essential for improving how they communicate their requirements, paving the way for more efficient and effective collaboration. By integrating UI elements and natural language input, we designed Data Formulator to let users to define their visualization needs with precision, leading to better results and reducing the need for multiple clarifications.",

This includes differences in image acquisition, the appearance of underlying pathologies, and population characteristics.",
            "Stress-testing multimodal models": "We have used RadEdit to stress-test image classification and segmentation models, and we see potential for future applications in complex multimodal tasks like generating radiology reports. RadEdit can help identify limitations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) like Microsoft’s MAIRA-1 and MAIRA-2, especially when dealing with rare conditions or unusual combinations of findings not well-represented in the training data. These MLLMs take one or more radiological images and relevant clinical information as input to produce detailed text reports.",
            "Implications and looking forward": "RadEdit offers significant advantages for the biomedical research community. It helps identify biases and blind spots before deployment, helping to ensure that biomedical vision models perform reliably in clinical settings. By simulating dataset shifts, RadEdit reduces the need to collect additional evaluation data, saving time and resources.",
