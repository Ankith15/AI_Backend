========================================
1. ROLLUP: Robinhood's Announcement Sets off Stock Tokens Frenzy
📖 Summary: https://youtu.be/ZGXn6yMABJ0
Ryan:
[0:03] Bankless Nation, for all our American listeners out there, happy 4th of July. Happy 4th of July to you, David. How are you doing? You're not actually in America on the 4th of July, are you?
David:
[0:12] No, I am in France, where everyone celebrates 4th of July every year, right?
Ryan:
[0:17] I don't know, man. You tell me I've never been there for 4th of July. What are you doing in France?
David:
[0:21] Oh, it's ECC week this week. One of the oldest running Ethereum conferences. Is unofficial, like not thrown by the EF, just bootstrapped by the community. And it's been running ever since, like, honestly, I think before I even got into Ethereum.
Ryan:
[0:35] Are you guys responsible for this 7% ETH increase on the week? Is that you? Is that ETHCC?
David:
[0:41] I thought that was you. I thought that was you holding.
Ryan:
[0:44] Down the fork. I'm happy to take credit for 7%. All right. We're going to talk about that. We got a lot more. Actually, I want to talk to you more about ETHCC, but let's give them a tour for what's in store on the Bankless Weekly Roll-Up. Tokenization Week? David, what's all this about?
David:
[0:59] Three different companies all decided to launch tokenized stocks on different blockchains this week. Not just Robinhood, not just X-Docs on Solana, but also Gemini is entering the fray with tokenized stocks, both on Arbitrum and also on Solana. So just three different companies just coming in with tokenized stocks. I guess they chose this week to launch them all.
Ryan:
[1:21] Yeah, it was a good week to do it. also a big win for Ethereum this week. So that Robinhood news that you mentioned, that's all happening on an Ethereum layer too. First Arbitrum and then an Arbitrum chain. So you got to give us a download on that. And David, I want to tell you about Tom Lee. This guy is going on CNBC and he is pumping our ETH bags, my friend. And I actually think this is the most bullish thing I've seen happen to Ethereum this year. And I want to tell you why.
David:
[1:46] I would agree. I actually met Tom Lee like three days ago at Permissionless. And I was like, oh, Tom, great to see you. And like three days later, he launches the micro strategy for his version of micro. Oh, I think it was under embargo, probably.
Ryan:
[2:00] OK. I mean, yeah,
David:
[2:01] He could have said something. I would agree. It's a very unexpected, extremely bullish surprise for ETH.
Ryan:
[2:07] Yeah, this is a Michael Saylor strategy. That's effectively what he's doing. He's building a publicly traded treasury strategy. Also, Solana has its first staked ETF.
Ryan:
[2:16] So we'll talk about that and we'll see how it's going. And some big news in the US this 4th of July, we've got Trump's big, beautiful bill. All right. That may have passed by the time you guys are listening to this. And what's that mean for crypto? Also, is Trump trying to replace Powell? He's got some names floating around in the ring and he's kind of threatening in the background. So we'll talk about that, too. But before we do, David, tell me a bit more about ECC. Like, give me the vibes. How are we feeling?
David:
[2:40] Yeah, it's in Cannes this year. It's usually in paris except for last year it was in brussels because of the olympics but we're in cannes this year which is a beach town that it's my first time here extremely hot it is like 95 degrees every single day so everyone is just sweating but since we're all sweating together it's okay, very well received event and so nothing is like too no one's like too crazy no one's too euphoric Everyone's like kind of getting work done. ETHCC has been like the spawn of the side event meta in crypto conferences. But this ETHCC was different. I think people said some very positive words about the main Ethereum conference. And I just saw a lot of, I have so many talks that I have saved that I need to watch that I just haven't gotten to yet. I've been running around. The week was started off by Robinhood's event, which they started.
Ryan:
[3:32] They can throw an event.
David:
[3:33] They were shuttling people back and forth. Yeah, they booked this massive chateau. They had this whole entire, like, bit of, like, a James Bond bit of Vlad driving a sports car up the, like, chateau road.
Ryan:
[3:47] He was looking good, man.
David:
[3:49] He was dressed to the park. He was going after Bond.
Ryan:
[3:52] Okay, Casino Royale stuff, okay.
David:
[3:54] Yeah, yeah. So that was the big excitement of the week. And overall, yeah, people are having a good time. Yeah.
Ryan:
[3:59] So it felt sober. It felt buildy. i mean robin hood was the huge coming out of that event it's sort of interesting like it's weird in a way seeing them come to etc because that's sort of a off the beaten path traditionally that's been kind of a dev focused nerdy we're talking about zk you know like stuff you know cryptography deep cryptography protocol research and here is robin hood what is it a 70 billion dollar company coming from the u.s 85 85 you would know right
David:
[4:26] Depends on when you look at it.
Ryan:
[4:28] And they're like they're there this year, which is big in and of itself.
David:
[4:33] Yes. Sponsoring the main event, right? Not just throwing the biggest side event here, but sponsoring the main event. Yeah. And like there were so many reporters at the Robin Hood event, like kind of doing the live coverage and they've just been throughout all of this week. Yeah.
Ryan:
[4:47] Well, Vitalik appeared on a panel with the Robin Hood folks, which is interesting. Also may have front run you on this, David, which is I watched the Vitalik. It was like a 20 minute keynote at ECC.
David:
[4:57] I've already watched that. Yeah.
Ryan:
[4:58] That's the benefit of being remote. I can watch it as soon as it drops. You actually have to attend the event in person.
David:
[5:03] Why do I go to the conference when you're beating me to the content?
Ryan:
[5:06] Because I can't, because I don't. And we appreciate you doing that because obviously you got to talk, you felt the vibes, you got to talk to the Robinhood folks in person, Arbitrum folks.
Ryan:
[5:15] Anyway, we'll talk a bit more about that at the end of the episode. I think first, we got to talk about prices as we do at the beginning of these episodes. And it's looking more bullish on the week? Tell me about it.
David:
[5:26] Fucking green. Yeah, Bitcoin up 2.6% on the week. It touched $110,000, currently coming in at $109,000.
Ryan:
[5:34] $2,700 ETH up a little bit more this week. So Bitcoin up 2.6%, ETH up 6.7%.
David:
[5:41] So I'm going to go ahead and call this a Ryan Sean Adams week.
Ryan:
[5:45] Sure, do it.
David:
[5:45] Both Bitcoin and ETH are up in dollar terms, but ETH is up in Bitcoin terms. That's what I do. That's a Ryan week. That's a Ryan week. Well done, Ryan. You're welcome. Did your job. So ETH coming in at $2,595. And so overall, pretty happy times on the markets this week.
Ryan:
[6:04] All right, Bitcoin, we're just touching all-time highs, right? It seems like we've been range-bound, 100K to 110K, but we haven't been able to break all-time highs, but we're creeping close.
David:
[6:14] I think the technical term for that is edging. We are edging right now.
Ryan:
[6:19] All right. When is our last all-time high, you know, climax?
David:
[6:24] It was June 9th. It's like, yeah, you're nailing it, actually.
Ryan:
[6:28] Okay, so less than a month ago, we were all-time high, and we might be there momentarily, I I suppose. Maybe by the time people listen to this episode.
David:
[6:35] $2,000 off of all-time high.
Ryan:
[6:37] That's not the only thing that's moving on the week. Tell me about some movers of the week. It's always weird looking at these seven-day charts. What tokens do you want to call out?
David:
[6:45] Just if you happen to have Pengu, Arbitrum, the Arbitrum token, or Fartcoin, congrats, those are the big movers of the week. All those are moving beyond 30% in a single week this week. Don't know why Pengu did it, but Arbitrum obviously did it because of all of the Robinhood news. And then Fartcoin, you know, is the greatest macro asset of all time. We got some great macro news this week, which we're going to get into as well.
Ryan:
[7:10] All right. The triple point asset. I mean, all of those things,
Ryan:
[7:12] maybe there's a theme to them. Maybe the theme is just there's more liquidity in the market and numbers going up. Let's talk about this Solana ETF. So lots of folks in the Solana community excited about this. This is notable because it's the first spot Solana ETF, the first crypto ETF.
David:
[7:29] No one was really watching this.
Ryan:
[7:31] Yeah, I mean, I heard some rumblings from the Bloomberg folks and then suddenly it's here. So it's notable because we have an ETH ETF, we have a Bitcoin ETF, and now we have a Solana ETF, nothing else. And also, David, the second thing is it's staking. It's full staking enabled. So you're not buying the sole asset, you're buying the staked sole asset inside of this ETF. And so I think there's a couple questions coming out of this. One, how did Solana get the staked ETF before Ethereum? And then two, how's it doing? So update us on that. Yeah.
David:
[8:04] Yeah, there's a weird nuance here. There's just an unusual structure as it relates to like how ETF typically comes into being. I don't know why this, how this is different, but this is a C-Corp. It's a C-Corp under the 1940 Act. I don't know what that means, but it allows a staking rewards to be paid out as dividends. The taxes for this thing is not as kind as if it were more of a traditional vanilla normal ETF. And then of course, how did it get passed? The SEC didn't like give this the explicit thumbs up they just also didn't give it a thumbs down which means that they just got to do it so.
Ryan:
[8:41] They just didn't say no and
David:
[8:42] Didn't say no and then they were like all right i guess we get to do this yeah i've never heard of this issuer is rex osprey soul i don't know who this issuer is.
Ryan:
[8:52] Not black it's not fidelity this is way down in
David:
[8:55] File for s1 i don't even know if Fidelity did or not. They did. So 80% of the ETF is in spot, sole, and then half of that is actively staked. And then there's also a mix of like JITO, sole, a variety of other like sole.
Ryan:
[9:08] Oh, only half of it. Only half of it is actively staked.
David:
[9:11] Only half is staked, yeah.
Ryan:
[9:13] Okay, interesting. And the fees on this are pretty high too. It's almost 75 bips here. I guess it's notable though that it did seep through. I get the feeling that the SEC doesn't want to be the no SEC. see they don't want to say no to crypto and so that's why this thing just kind of seeped through i mean any overall odd
David:
[9:33] Though yeah i would be somewhat disappointed if i was like i don't know if like bitwise filed for us on the etf but there's like other issuers out there that have filed for us on an etf and i would be kind of bitter if i was them and i'm like an etf issuer and there's like.
Ryan:
[9:47] I don't know you know i guess there there was with other etfs it was a race for first right and there was a horse race you know who could be first who could get the most volume, I feel like probably all the ETF issuers are happy right now because this is an SEC that's not going to say no to crypto. And all of the things are probably going to get approved. I'm sure we see an ETH staking ETF sometime soon in the fullness of time. The volume on this was pretty strong, according to Eric Balchunas, about 20 million. So that's top 1% of ETFs for first day launch. So pretty, I guess it met expectations or exceeded some expectations. A note here, It's still kind of peanuts compared to the Bitcoin ETF and even the Ethereum ETF in terms of volume. So it's, you know, it's good for a down market asset. We should call it small potatoes. It's small. Look at this. So actually on Farside Crypto, you know these tarts we've been looking at? Oh, they've got the Solana one? Yeah. So they've got it here, right? So we'll be able to look at that and compare it to Bitcoin, which is absolutely massive. And then Ether has been seeing a tremendous amount of strength here recently as well.
David:
[10:51] I have just two comments about this. I think this is a pretty positive indicator towards the growing wave of down market ETFs that are definitely coming by the end of this year. So it's going to be the first of many. You're going to see a Dogecoin ETF. You're probably going to see a Ripple ETF. We're going to see this far side ETF charts just kind of populate. And then also, my take is that the staking component of these proof of stake network ETFs is marginal. And I'm not like bullish. I'm not more bullish because all of a sudden there's like a staking ETF. I don't really think that's going to create that much more demand.
Ryan:
[11:25] I pretty much agree with you that it's marginal, although I will note. So the cost of just holding like something like vanilla Solana, for instance, is negative 4.5% dilution every year.
David:
[11:34] Yeah, that's true. It's actually much more critical for Solana at an 8% issuance rate versus ETH, which is like a 2 point something percent issuance rate.
Ryan:
[11:42] Yeah, so Solana is 4.5% issuance, actually.
David:
[11:46] But yields are high. Yields are seven.
Ryan:
[11:48] Yields are higher because you're making money on MEV and fee revenue and that kind of thing. But yeah, but for, yeah, I guess that makes sense that you would include all of yields because that's a missed opportunity. Yeah. So we've got some other commentary on the SEC here too about tokenized
Ryan:
[12:01] stocks that we'll get to. But David, I want to ask you a question. How are you feeling about your job, man? You feeling good job security right now? What? Dude, we're business partners. This is to queue you up to talk about the jobs report because you should feel great about your job. The jobs numbers are looking good. The jobs numbers are looking great.
David:
[12:22] I keep my job?
Ryan:
[12:23] Yeah, I guess so.
David:
[12:25] Okay, I keep my job.
Ryan:
[12:26] Unemployment is only 4.1%. And these are estimates higher than what analysts were expecting. So they had expected 4.3%. It was actually 4.1%. So good macro indicators there. Here's a commentary. Strong unemployment report. Interesting initial market reaction. So what happened on the back of this was stocks went up, rates, so bond rates got higher, crypto went down. And so this analyst is saying, tells you the market believes crypto prices are more dependent on liquidity, whereas stocks are trading on fundamentals. And the chance of a July rate cut, Fed rate cut just got killed. So stocks on fundamentals and crypto prices, liquidity, that's kind of a take here.
David:
[13:08] It does feel like the stock market is the center of attention right now. And the crypto markets are kind of just trend following. That's what it feels like to me.
Ryan:
[13:18] Yeah, I could see that. And here's a chart that Mike Nato pulled up for me yesterday when we were going through sort of our monthly fundamentals episode. This is a cross-border capital.
David:
[13:28] I like those, by the way. Those are really great.
Ryan:
[13:29] Yeah, you like those? Okay. Do you listen to it?
David:
[13:31] You guys have only done. Yeah, I've listened to the first like half, but you guys have only done two, right?
Ryan:
[13:35] Yeah. Yeah. And toward the end, he gets to this chart, which is a weekly global liquidity. There's all sorts of different indices. This is one from cross-border capital. And you can see kind of an ebbed up to $180 trillion back just, you know, I guess, you know, that was probably May and now it's back down again. But this is the measure of if you believe that crypto prices go up when there's more liquidity in terms of, you know, dollars, money printing, all of these things, then you look at this chart. And I'm a big believer. I'm a subscriber to the idea that But all of these markets, especially in crypto, are all driven by this chart right here.
David:
[14:08] Because it's the denominator. Global liquidity is the denominator of especially crypto assets, which are commodity money assets. I'll add one more nuance that a lot of the Bitcoin or macro like an analyst that I pay attention to will all say that Bitcoin price is a two year lagging indicator of global liquidity. So global liquidity shows up and then two years later that shows up in the Bitcoin price. And this global liquidity indicator has been going up straight since December of 2022. And Bitcoin has been following that trend. The bull, the bull hopium that I will happily dish out here is that we have like another year plus of Bitcoin up and therefore crypto up because of global liquidity.
Ryan:
[14:51] I think that's true. And you can chart it as a straight line, but there are you notice in the chart these dips, right? It goes kind of like up and then there's a little dip down and then there's another there's. Yeah, it's a sawtooth. I like that. Man, you're a charter, aren't you? OK, so here's the thing that could affect global liquidity coming from the U.S. It's a one-two combo punch. So you got to look at monetary policy, of course, and what's Powell doing? What's the Fed rate doing? And then you have to look at fiscal policy, right? Because Lynn Alden told us nothing stops this train.
Ryan:
[15:20] So let's look at both. First, we'll talk about monetary policy on the week. So Powell has been, people call him hawkish. I don't know. Maybe he's just being normal. But Trump wants him to be very, very much more dovish. He wants him to cut rates. And he's looking at, he says, unemployment's, you know, doing very well. That's an indicator, you know, inflation CPI is kind of down. So he's like, Powell, why don't you cut rates? And this week, the conversation coming from Scott Besant and also Trump, I mean, he's always talking about this, is that a Fed Chair Powell's successor is coming in as soon as weeks from now. So indicating that Trump is going to name Powell's successor. Okay. Can you imagine that? If your boss was just like named your replacement, it was like, you know,
David:
[16:09] Well, you still.
Ryan:
[16:10] Have a job. Yeah. You suck. And I hate you. And we're going to hire this new guy. And I wish you weren't here. And here here he is. Like, that's what.
David:
[16:18] And his name is Rady McRate cut.
Ryan:
[16:21] Exactly. So I don't know. This the successor has not been named, but the successor could come, according to Besant, weeks from now. So there's a poly market, of course, for this. Who will Trump announce as the next Fed chair? And guess who one of the answers is? You'll never guess. Scott Besson. It's Scott Besson. It's Scott Besson. Oh, he's at 21 percent. Yeah. He's the second highest. So. So, yeah, that's one of the chief candidates is, you know, Scott Besson, 21 percent.
David:
[16:50] You can just put the Federal Reserve is supposed to be a nonpolitical organization. And Scott Besson is a member of Trump's administration. What's going on here? Yeah.
Ryan:
[17:00] Well, you just take the Treasury guy and you move him to, you know, a Fed chair and you could do that. We all know what Scott Besson would do. I mean, he's very much with Trump. He was with him with all of the tariffs, even though the rest of Wall Street thought that was a good idea. He's very articulate. He's a good communicator. I mean, you could totally see Scott Besson.
David:
[17:18] I enjoy Scott Besson.
Ryan:
[17:20] You enjoy his. He's he sounds so reasonable.
David:
[17:24] Yeah, I enjoy him. I think he's better than any Democratic economic advisor that I've ever listened to.
Ryan:
[17:29] So whether it's Scott Besson or whoever Trump names, what do you think he's going to do to rate cuts?
David:
[17:34] A Cuddy McCuddy face.
Ryan:
[17:37] Yeah, it's going to be Cuddy McCuddy face. All right. So now Powell's tenure goes to May of 2026. All right. And so there's technically there seems like there's no way to fire Powell. Right. And no one has ever done this. So no president in the full Fed history has actually named the replacement before while the guy was on the job. Right. So this is all unprecedented territory, but this points to, we're just looking at the liquidity charts. What do you think in the fullness of time, whether it's in the coming months and Powell capitulates and starts cutting rates or whether it's his replacement, rates are getting cut, right? Am I wrong here?
David:
[18:16] Like crypto prices are going up for the remainder of the Trump presidency if he gets his way.
Ryan:
[18:21] It feels very much the case. All right. So that's the monetary side. And let's check in on the on the fiscal side. So we've talked about this before. The big, beautiful bill.
David:
[18:30] The point I've made about Scott Besson being on the Trump admin moving into the Federal Reserve is the fiscal side penetrating into the monetary side. So it's really fiscal all the way down because nothing stops this train.
Ryan:
[18:44] Yeah, kind of. Exactly. And you know, you're you're civic. So Congress is supposed to hold the purse strings of the entire U.S. Government on, you know, the U.S. Government layer one and monetary and fiscal policy and all of these things. And they are looking at a bill.
Ryan:
[18:59] Probably by the time people listen to this, that bill will have passed the House. But we don't know. Bankless listeners are living in the future. Currently for David and I, it's up for vote in the House and it passed the Senate passed by one vote. OK, so they had to call in. it was really tight here.
David:
[19:15] The vice president.
Ryan:
[19:16] They had to call in J.D. Vance to pass it. So pass the Senate. Looks like it's going to pass the House. The reason I know that is because we've got some odds here, 92% odds on Polymarket that it will have passed by the time bankless listeners are listening to this. So let's assume it does. That's about $4 trillion to the deficit in the next 10 years because it's a combo of pretty big tax cuts, no tax hikes, and some expense cutting as well, right? So it's a deficit bill. It's caused some division in the Republican Party. Elon Musk has infamously or famously said, like, you do this, I'm going to launch a whole other political party. But it looks like it's going to pass. And so the U.S. Is essentially deciding to double down on its deficit and double down on its debt. This is the one-two combo punch, David, for global liquidity.
David:
[20:06] How much is the current amount of U.S. debt?
Ryan:
[20:09] I mean, 36 trillion, something like this.
David:
[20:12] 36 trillion. So we're just adding four more trillion. So we're adding, what is that? We're adding 10%? No. Yeah, 10%. Yeah, we're adding 10% onto the debt. Wow, that's a large number.
Ryan:
[20:23] You think that's a large number? I mean, it's all a large number, right? And I mean, the question is, what do you think? How do you think this ends?
David:
[20:29] We're adding four Bitcoins to the debt.
Ryan:
[20:33] That's one way of looking at it for sure.
David:
[20:36] Excuse me, only two Bitcoins. I forgot Bitcoin and how high Bitcoin is. Bitcoin's two trillion.
Ryan:
[20:41] There are some bulls on the back of this that say, look, you tax cuts, you stimulate the economy, we just grow our way out, right? And there's maybe some case out there that AI tech, the frontier here is so bullish. Look, man, I just got off a podcast earlier this week while you were out. Kathy Wood was telling me we're going to grow at seven to eight percent GDP,
David:
[21:00] Okay? The U.S.
Ryan:
[21:02] Is going to be on the back of AI and the full innovation set. If that's the case, maybe this doesn't matter so much. All right? So you could bet on that.
David:
[21:12] I cannot imagine ourselves growing out of $40 trillion of debt, accruing 4.5% interest.
Ryan:
[21:20] Well, that's what the strategy is. And unless something drastic changes, we can't grow our way out. So this means that God help anyone holding U.S. treasuries and bonds right now. I mean, that is just slow motion exit liquidity for doing that. And I think this is bullish for gold, for Bitcoin, for Ethereum, for commodities, for capital assets. Oh, God. When you went there. David, what do we have coming up next?
David:
[21:44] Coming up next, not one, not two, but three different companies launched tokenized stocks all across the blockchain ecosystem. We're going to talk about all of them. Leading with Robinhood, that's the event that I went to. So I can tell you exactly what that Robinhood event was like on the ground. In addition to the tokenized stocks products, there's a slew of other products as well. Very aggressively getting into the crypto space. You know, Robinhood and Coinbase were kind of in their own lanes for a good long while for this small section of like, you know, that you could buy Bitcoin and a few other cryptos on Robinhood.
David:
[22:13] Now they are very much breathing each other's air. So we're going to talk about that. And also the Robinhood layer two on Arbitrum, using Arbitrum tech, we're going to talk about all of that and more. But first, a message to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors.
Ryan:
[22:25] We got Robinhood announcing tokenized stocks and an Ethereum layer two. This is big, big, big stuff. And David, you know how I know is this is Vlad, the CEO of Robinhood. And he is armed with a smart guy chalkboard here. And he's doing some smart guy drawing on the chalkboard to diagram what I think he's describing, which is tokenized stocks on Robinhood. You were there for this presentation at ECC. Tell me what was going on. What is Vlad describing in this video?
David:
[22:55] He's just doing a good old whiteboarding session, chalkboarding session of drawing the diagrams of here's Bill. Bill wants to buy tokenized stock. Bill sends his money to Robinhood. Robinhood sends his money to the broker-dealer. Broker-dealer goes to the marketplace, buys a stock. Stock goes back and then like that's the basic like pretty normal but then he was like okay but here's what happens when it's after hours and bill wants to buy a stock because then it goes to the after hours exchange which is our exchange bit stamp that we bought but then also if it's a better price on arbitrum where we're deploying these stocks it's going to go to arbitrum and so he was just like you know drawing all the lines to like really.
Ryan:
[23:35] Enjoying your voiceover of what he's doing here on screen.
David:
[23:39] He did a great job. I was like looking at him and he was like, okay, he's using the correct amount of space on the chalkboard. He's not cramming his letters. Clearly he's done this a few times. Overall, their whole entire presentation was like one gigantic bit, which was like, it was pretty scripted. It was kind of cheesy at times, but I enjoyed it. It was fun.
Ryan:
[23:58] Yeah, okay. So this presentation or something like it, to catch a token, the presentation, 22 million clicks on Twitter, I think. A lot of people watching Vlad on the chalkboard.
David:
[24:07] They were streaming it directly on Twitter on X. And yeah, 22, like an X view is pretty...
Ryan:
[24:13] Cheap.
David:
[24:13] It's just like one click and one person watches it for one second. But yeah, 22 million people clicked in and looked at it for at least momentarily.
Ryan:
[24:21] Well done. I mean, that's just like smart guy vibes when you're drawn on a chalkboard in front of, you know, well done here. Okay. Tell us, I know you interviewed him, you talked to him, you also talked to the Arbitrum folks. What are the highlights of what Robinhood announced here? Tell us about the tokenized stock thing and anything else you want to cover. Yeah.
David:
[24:38] Overall, when I was talking to everyone, I was like, all right, like, did this event and all of its announcements, did they meet your expectations? Was it under your expectations? Where were all the announcements as it relates to your expectations? And almost everyone said it exceeded their expectations specifically because of the tokenized private equity, which is a derivative of their tokenized stock announcement. So we'll start with the tokenized stocks. They are doing tokenized stocks for EU citizens. So this is only for European Union citizens. and they just have the broker-dealer relationships. You can buy Apple, you can buy all the regular stocks and now they are deploying them as tokens on the Arbitrum One blockchain.
Ryan:
[25:18] Like 200 stocks, like a pretty good selection, right? US capital stocks, yeah. Indeed.
David:
[25:22] And like I've been talking to some EU people and they have they express that, like, apparently this is actually a difficult thing to do in the EU is access American stocks, which I was surprised to learn. Somebody was telling me of a story of like they wanted to buy NVIDIA and they had to go to their brokerage and they had to go like, please, I would like to buy NVIDIA. And they were like, no, it's too risky. And that's what it was. Yeah. I was surprised. That's like when you and I complain about going to our banks and we have to wire money and they're like, what is the wire for?
Ryan:
[25:52] So it's even more nanified over there? Yeah.
David:
[25:55] Exactly. Yeah. Awesome. Like NVIDIA, which is something that's publicly traded on the U.S. stock market, their brokerages don't allow. I don't know if this is pervasive. Maybe this was just this one individual story. I don't really know how pervasive this is across Europe. But apparently accessing U.S. equities is not trivial in the EU.
Ryan:
[26:12] And even for us, right? There's benefits in being on chain. So you've got fractional ownership. So you can buy a portion of a stock, right? With our tokenized stuff, you can buy any micro fraction of any of the tokens you want. In traditional brokerages, you have to buy the full amount or basically nothing. So it's more divisible in that way. Also, it's 24-7, 365. It's like crypto markets. It never shuts down. That's a benefit.
David:
[26:37] This is a really cool thing that showed me that Robinhood had done a very good job creating a pretty elegantly integrated ecosystem. So they have their normal brokerage, which gives them the stocks. Then they make a token. And that token can now go trade on Bitstamp, their exchange that they bought like two years ago. And so when the stock market is down, pop quiz, Ryan, about what percentage of time is the stock market not trading?
Ryan:
[27:06] I haven't quantified it, but it's gotta be more than 50% because you got holidays and then you've got just all of the non-business hours, right? Is it 60%?
David:
[27:17] It's 81% of time.
Ryan:
[27:19] God, that's stupid.
David:
[27:20] 81% of the time, markets are closed, which like the notion of a closed market is insane to me. Markets are a phenomenon. They are an emergent phenomenon. They don't, in theory, close. The fact that we just close our markets is just silly. And so with tokenized stocks that can trade on a crypto exchange, we now have stocks that can have like 24-7, 365 price discovery. About time. Because that's just the speed of the world that we live in in 2025. And then also, Robinhood can order.
Ryan:
[27:50] A route if
David:
[27:51] The price is preferable on Bitstamp the exchange or if the price is preferable on on-chain, like on Arbitrum, Uniswap or wherever. They can just go source the best price. So it's worth noting how impactful 24-7, 365 price discovery is. You can always kind of tell when something is happening in the world because Bitcoin will move on the weekend and that will inform the stock market on Monday. But now the stock market has a venue, which it's Robinhood, to trade 24-7, 365. Also, say, for example, some crisis, some global crisis did happen and Robinhood's the only place to get price discovery there. They get all those fees on Bitstamp or on their chain, which they announced, which I'll get into in a second. So overall, pretty cool.
Ryan:
[28:37] We'll talk about the structure of these things in a little bit, But the other thing I want to get to is it's I had FOMO already. I'm like, I'm not EU citizen. I can't access these on-chain stocks yet. But then also my FOMO just skyrocketed when I saw actual private shares of companies that I'd really like to own, like OpenAI and SpaceX here too. So it's not just the public companies. Robinhood also threw out some private company tokens as well. You can't access in US, you just can't access anywhere. What is this and how did they do it?
David:
[29:12] You, if you try really, really hard, you can go find a way to go get SpaceX shares OTC or OpenAI shares OTC. Just because they are not publicly traded does not mean that they are not tradable or sellable. It's just a little bit of a different dynamic.
Ryan:
[29:27] Like some peer-to-peer OTC desk type thing. Like you got to find the seller, you know, and it's an employee somewhere, right?
David:
[29:34] Mm-hmm. And companies can approve those sales or not approve those sales because that's just the nature of what happens when they're still private. But like, oh, SpaceX shares do trade with some amount of like frequency and volume that's not unheard of. OpenAI is the new one. Vlad said that they somehow had this relationship with some private wealth manager hedge fund that had access to some of these shares. And that's how they got a hold of these things. But they are now tokenizing private companies, starting with OpenAI and SpaceX. So they're doing this big campaign where they're going to just airdrop these tokens to EU citizens who sign up over the next seven days. Airdrop for free.
Ryan:
[30:09] Yeah.
David:
[30:10] For free, yeah, but it's probably only going to be like $5 or $10, but it's still pretty sick. But man, like, OpenAI, I would smash buy on that for up to a very high price. It's just pretty cool. And like, there's other companies out there, like OpenAI, SpaceX, also Stripe. These are some of the coolest companies. And the world of like, you know, private venture-backed trad companies, they're just staying private for longer. They are. They don't need to go public, which is kind of a bummer for people like me, you, the listener who wants to get our hands on these things.
Ryan:
[30:39] Yeah, that's the part that remains to be seen is how much access they actually have to this pipeline, whether it's just kind of a one time thing for promo purposes or whether that's sustainable and durable. There's actually a little bit of drama around this as well, where OpenAI actually tweeted this out. These OpenAI tokens are not OpenAI equity. We did not partner with Robinhood. We're not involved in this. Do not endorse it. Any transfer OpenAI equity requires our approval. We did not approve any transfer. Please be careful. What's going on here? Yeah.
David:
[31:08] So like I said, if you're a private company, you have the authority to approve or not approve sales of your equity of your stock. And so it really the how Vlad and Robinhood came to acquire these tokens really matters or what the nature is between the investor ownership over those tokens. I don't really think we know that story, but it would be a pretty big blunder for Vlad to just say that they have these things and then not actually have some amount of assurance that they do actually have them. So I'm going to lean with the benefit of the doubt. Like, yeah, Robinhood, Vlad does have a real claim on these things somehow. Maybe they're a derivative of a token. Maybe some market maker is just agreeing to set a price. I don't really know. But he tweeted out saying like, yeah, they're not technically equity. You're right. But they are one to one of the value. I think we're all kind of looking for more clarity as to how this works.
Ryan:
[31:59] Well, that's the thing. OK, so these tokenized stocks in all cases that we're going to talk about them aren't sort of like one for one equity. At least this is my understanding. So in the scenario with the Robinhood stocks, for instance, you're buying some sort of vehicle IOU. You're not buying the stock directly, right? You're buying a vehicle that is almost like a derivative to for the actual shares that Robinhood owns. And they're kind of issuing this derivative on-chain. And there can be weird things that happen with that, right? So when you're trading the market 24 hours a day, that sort of on-chain asset can not mirror exactly the price of the actual asset in real life because there is a different liquidity profile effectively. So there's some downsides to these assets. They're not as good as the the actual only the actual token stock in an exchange. I think there are a lot of people on on Twitter who are pointing that out as well, that this is almost like a beta version of the thing. You don't actually own the equity itself.
David:
[33:04] Yeah, it's likely a pretty convoluted process as to how a user will actually come to own these things. And like you said, the investor protection is probably not as strong. It's just not dissimilar from like, OpenAI is like the Federal Reserve and then they're looking at all the dollars in the offshore Tether bank account. And then they're saying those aren't really dollars. And technically they could make them not really dollars, but would they? And then also there's like another entity, middleman entity,
David:
[33:31] like making this whole thing work. So it's just a little bit convoluted. we'll see how good of a product these things are based on how much trading volume there is and how much like true price discovery there is and like you know there's a bunch of things to iron out but my big takeaway we're going to get into the remaining other two tokenized stock in companies but there's a just a big foot in the door like the overton window is moving here and the notion of accessing these companies and tokenizing stocks on chain is like very real this is a very real thing.
Ryan:
[34:02] And Robinhood, we should let everyone know, is a broker dealer for stocks already in a way that Coinbase is not, in a way that Kraken is not. I mean, that's their whole shtick. They've been selling stocks for, you know, not a decade, but like many years. That's the thing that they do.
David:
[34:16] Robinhood has been selling stocks for a decade. They came out in 2013.
Ryan:
[34:19] Okay. So let's talk about the second thing that moves the Overton window and is kind of a big shift, which is the Robinhood chain. So at first, my understanding is they're issuing these tokenized stocks on the Arbitrum chain itself, the Arbitrum chain, the one that you know that's been in Maynet for a while. In the future, though, they're going to have their own official Robinhood chain that uses Arbitrum tech, but is its own separate chain. One would assume completely integrated with Arbitrum one, but an official Robinhood chain, the same way that Coinbase has the base chain. Is that right?
David:
[34:54] That is exactly right. And the way, like, it was a huge deal when Coinbase made the base chain, because it was the largest company, traditional company, equity company to make a blockchain. It was very validating of some of the things that we've said before is like, oh, yeah, financial entities will all use their own chain. They'll use chain, the blockchain to have their logic run on chain. It's gonna be great. But the difference here is Coinbase is crypto native. Robinhood is firmly in TradFi. Robinhood doesn't have to do this. Coinbase needs to invest in the ecosystem for their own benefit, right? They need to spawn products. They need to really expand growing on-chain. Robinhood doesn't necessarily have to do that. Robinhood is TradFi. They sell stocks. They sell, you know, crypto represents 30% of their revenue, but not 100. And so this was very optional for them to do. And they did it. And I think that is a huge vote of confidence to the notion that financial entities will make chains and they will put assets on those chains.
Ryan:
[35:56] Big win for Ethereum here. And it's also nice, too, that we have multiple competitors entering the fray. We got Base, we have Arbitrum, and we have the Robinhood chain. And as you said, this is a traditional company going on chain, which is a big deal. Okay, so by the way, the hood shares were up like 11% on this. The data announced Arbitrum's been catching a bit. We talked about the ARB token earlier in the episode. ETH completely flat. Well, I guess up 6% on the week, but not directly as a result of this announcement. So how this plays out in the market remains to be seen. What else did Robinhood announce? Just go through the list. Yeah, they launched Perpetual Futures for EU citizens.
David:
[36:35] And so they have this very slick perps interface, which, God, retail is just going to love. Retail already loves options on Robinhood. Options is where Robinhood makes a lot of their money. Perps, I think, is just options, in my opinion, but better. Maybe you can do some funny things with options, some more expressive things. But perps is just like, it's a leverage slider. Retail is going to love it. And they've built out the slickest perp interface. Again, only available for the EU, but you would imagine as soon as the CFTC greenlights this for the United States, they're going to just open this up for the United States. So perps is a thing. And then also just a few other things as well. Crypto staking. So you can now stake your ETH, stake your Solana inside of Robinhood and also a crypto credit card. So Robinhood already had a credit card. You get like 3% cash back, but now you can get 3% cash back that goes and buys your preferred crypto asset.
Ryan:
[37:24] Yeah, I should mention all of this is integrated in the slickness of the Robinhood app, right? It doesn't even feel like you're on chain. Remember, we talked to Vlad like three years ago when he came to a permissionless conference. That was our first conversation with Vlad, and it was clear that they were new to crypto. But he was telling us about the user interface and how important haptics were. You know, like a little buzz.
David:
[37:41] Yeah, haptics, yeah. You get a buzz feedback.
Ryan:
[37:42] In your mobile phone when something good happens in the app. I'm sure they're doing all of those things, which is pretty cool.
David:
[37:50] A mobile wallet with haptics to tokenize stocks. Robinhood, you guys have done great.
Ryan:
[37:55] We need more dopamine hits. This is DC Investor. In case it isn't clear, Robinhood and Coinbase are going to full-on compete head-to-head against each other to drive on-chain adoption on Ethereum via optimism and arbitrum. And they're not going to be the last ones to join the fray either. Bullish. I think the community sees this as pretty bullish.
David:
[38:13] I think the Robinhood versus Coinbase take is the pretty easy take to have. I just did an episode with David from Blackworks Research and Omar from Dragonfly. Omar representing Robinhood and David representing Coinbase. And we kind of like sussed out this conversation of like, how competitive are these two entities?
Ryan:
[38:31] And like the big takeaway from everyone there was like, actually, the swim lanes are pretty distinct.
David:
[38:36] Like they're mostly sticking to their own lanes. Coinbase is really trying to go to like crypto as a service and plug into like TD Ameritrade and like Fidelity and like all the boomer brokerages who are just never going to build their own crypto exchange. They're just going to plug into Coinbase and have crypto exchange via Coinbase. And so Coinbase is going to do a little B2B stuff. And they're also going competitive with Visa to do payments with BASE and USDC. And so Coinbase is actually leaning to be more of a service provider towards TradFi financial pre-existing entities, whereas Robinhood is strictly just we are retail, retail products, retail finance. And like the swim lanes are pretty distinct. And like, yes, now there's BASE versus Robinhood chain. They're both trying to do tokenized stocks. So now they are starting to actually like, you know, interfere in each other's air. But for the most part, there was consensus about like these two entities are definitely going to coexist pretty well.
Ryan:
[39:35] That's interesting, because when I look at this at a higher level, it just looks like pure convergence. But maybe there is some different place here. A few other points of convergence. That was not the only tokenized stock thing in the news this week. Xstocks on Solana, which is a partnership from Bakkt Finance. OK, this is the issuer of Xstocks. And Kraken and some others launched a similar tokenized stock offering, this time on Solana. And the way this manifested in my feed was tweets like this, this one from Mert, where I think Mert is swapping some fart coin for S&P 500. All right. Which you can now do on Solana using this vehicle.
David:
[40:11] I feel like you should go the other way.
Ryan:
[40:14] You should sell your S&P 500 for Solana. I guess if it's liquidity season. And you definitely have the option to do that. So not only this, but you also mentioned Gemini is launching tokenized stocks. I think we really need to dig into what these things are. We actually have an episode we're recording with one of the issues, Denari, and they power partially the Solana X stocks, tokenized stocks, and also this Gemini tokenized stock offering. And they were just approved as the first platform to be able to get their broker-dealer license and to offer tokenized U.S. stocks to domestic investors. So David, I don't even know what all of this means yet. And I feel like you and I need to do an entire episode to figure it out, like what these different tokenized stock offerings are, how good they are compared to existing stocks you buy in your brokerage, and what the future is here. This is a tweet thread from somebody who is kind of bearish.
David:
[41:10] This is Rob from Dragonfly.
Ryan:
[41:12] Okay. Yeah. What's Rob's take here? Why is he bullish on these offerings in general? Or bearish, I should say, on these offerings.
David:
[41:18] Yeah, he's basically saying there's just a lot of hurdles that these things need to get over in order to be effective products. Because when tokenized stocks trade during after hours, then without because there actually is not one to one backed, they're more of a derivative product. Then there's market, there's pricing risk that market makers have to account for. And overall, it's just blunt tool. Denari is one to one backed, but there's just a lot of details that I think everyone's trying to understand about these things. Like, for example, how does Denari not have a whitelist? Those are freely transferable blacklist tokens, whereas the Robinhood tokens, those are whitelisted. So, like, you need to have KYC in order to get your hands on those things. So how these work is going to be really interesting if Denari continues to offer stock, but, like, say, Lazarus Group hacks a smart contract and then all of a sudden Lazarus Group owns Apple. Sure.
Ryan:
[42:12] It's the tether problem, too. It's the tether problem, right? Yeah. So all of those kinks need to be worked out. I mean, at the end of the day, I think Rob is bullish, but sees these as kind of like, you know, early stage beta type versions of what will the future be.
David:
[42:25] Everyone's very excited.
Ryan:
[42:26] He's pumping the brakes. Yeah, he's throwing some cold water on it. Okay. But you know who's actually, you know who actually hates it is traditional finance. This is the financial industry. They're pushing back on tokenized equity, urging the SEC to reject crypto firms exemptions because they say this is going to cause liquidity fragmentation. You're going to lose investor protection with these things they're not real stocks and this is all like risk to market structure and by the way to your point you know north korea compliance aml kyc's price discovery is going to suck don't let this happen sec so this is old traditional finance not new traditional finance like robin hood pushing back on this whole concept because their entire business is at stake david these banks do not want you know new entrants to go and chomp and, you know, software eat their entire business. So the big question is, what does the SEC think about this? You can imagine if this was the Gary Gensler regime, you'd already, like, none of this would be happening. Banhammer. Banhammer, just like speeches and tweets and all sorts of things. But this is Paul Atkins, who was asked on CNBC, this very question by the interviewer. And here's what he had to say. This is Paul Atkins, the new chair of the SEC. What do you make of these sort of tokenization efforts? I mean, it seems to me that we have rules. We could debate whether the rules are the right rules and maybe they should be changed. But given the rules that are in place and the intention of the rule today,
Ryan:
[43:51] It seems to me that the effort to sort of, quote unquote, tokenize something, you know, an underlying asset and to sort of use this structure is really effectively just a workaround to what the actual intent of the rule is. Well, I guess I disagree with that a bit because tokenization is an innovation. And we at the SEC should be focused on how do we advance innovation in the marketplace. And so I would argue here over the last several years, the SEC has been standing athwart efforts to innovate in the marketplace because things have been unclear. The rules have not been clear. We've had regulation through enforcement. That day is over. We are now, my whole goal is to make things transparent, you know, from the regulatory aspect and give people a firm foundation upon which to innovate and come out with new products so that they know what they're doing. David, this is not an SEC that's going to say no.
David:
[44:51] Wow. That is, this is truly a Overton window being pushed. It's one thing for them to like get our get their boots off of our neck, but to give not a green light, but like a keep going like wordage to tokenize stocks is huge. Andrew, like made a very good point. Like these things are workarounds. Yeah, they are. Yeah. One of the reasons why I'm in crypto is like some of the things that we do, the new things that we do in crypto are all kind of slightly illegal. And that's what makes it exciting.
Ryan:
[45:19] They're works. OK, they're workarounds.
David:
[45:21] You know, we're great. It's all gray areas. It questions a lot of the rules that we have in how we operate in the world. And now that we have workarounds, we have alternatives. And I see Paul Atkins being like, you know what? Why are the old ways the ways to do it? Let's do it in new ways. And I am a huge fan of that.
Ryan:
[45:41] So am I. We got more bullish stuff after the break. Tom Lee, I call him David, the Wall Street whisperer. He set up a micro strategy for ETH and he's calling ETH the next Bitcoin on CNBC. We'll talk about that. Also, Coinbase tucks in an acquisition.
Ryan:
[45:55] And is your crypto co-worker secretly working for North Korea? My God, that sounds like a BuzzFeed headline. We'll talk about all that and more. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible. All right. I think this is the most bullish thing to happen to Ethereum this year. And we've had a number of bullish things, but this tops them all. This is Tom Lee. He is starting a ETH treasury company. He's going on CNBC. He's saying things like ETH is the next Bitcoin. All right. And he's basically pulling the micro strategy play. So he's taking a publicly traded Bitcoin mining company. It's called Bitmine. And he's announcing a 250 million private placement to buy ETH. So he's basically taking the shell of an entity. They're stopping the Bitcoin mining. And he's announcing a treasury strategy. It's very similar to, we just talked about Joseph Lubin, what he's doing with SBET, different business, but similar strategy. The raise is backed by major crypto traditional finance investors. You got your Pantera, you got your Galaxy, you got your Founders Fund, you got your Kraken. But the difference between this, and I think SBET and Lubin, is almost like the difference between where we're talking about Base and Robinhood. All right. So like Coinbase is a crypto native company. Joseph Lubin, he's crypto native. Of course he's going to do ETH. Of course he's. Is it a surprise that he's bullish on ETH and wants to stack more in a public entity? Tom Lee is not one of us. He is from traditional finance. He is a Wall Street guy.
David:
[47:24] He's one of them.
Ryan:
[47:24] He's one of them. Look at him. He wears a suit. Look at him. He is now starting this treasury fund. It's the first of its kind for Ether the asset. I think he's a TradFi KOL, David. The other thing is he's got a history of success. He's on CNBC almost all the time, every week. And he started talking about bitcoin in july of 2017 and do you remember him during the the bull run of 2017 that whole era of crypto he was like the only guy on cnbc saying things like at the time what bitcoin was you know trading in the the thousands he was saying that that bitcoin could cannibalize gold and it could be worth as much as 55 000 and in 2017 that was batshit crazy that
David:
[48:12] Was a 55x.
Ryan:
[48:13] Yes that was a 55x and it was crazy and he was saying it to trad find cnbc and they'd be like okay whatever but tell us about stocks all right so he's got that history almost 10 years back of of saying hey the bitcoin you remember when i made those calls when bitcoin was trading the thousands and now it's a hundred thousand now he's like
David:
[48:34] Doing it again.
Ryan:
[48:34] I'm doing it again except I'm going to like do this in a treasury fund and ETH is going there as well. And you know what? We should just play a clip. Let me tell you like his pitch. It's different than what our pitch would be for ETH
David:
[48:47] Or the asset. Let me guess. It's for TradFi.
Ryan:
[48:49] He calls stablecoins the open AI for crypto and Ethereum. Anyway, this is what he says. This is how he pitches it. Underneath the stablecoin industry is Ethereum. That is really like the backbone and architecture of stablecoins. So it's important to create a project that essentially accumulates Ethereum to essentially protect and have some influence on the network. So that's why we're creating this treasury vehicle to buy Ethereum. The more Ethereum that's accumulated, the more secure the network is. And I think it's also sort of the architecture that future banks will have. You know, when Goldman issues a stablecoin and JPMorgan doing it on Ethereum, as a layer one blockchain, they're going to want to secure it by staking Ethereum. So we're trying to get in front of that by creating a treasury. That's the pitch. You guys are already bullish on stablecoins, right? Most of the stablecoins are issued on Ethereum, okay? Most of the banks will issue stablecoins. those banks will want to have a stake in the network and buy ETH. And I'm just front running that. That's his entire pitch.
David:
[49:53] With Robinhood and Coinbase, like both of Robinhood's at all-time highs. Coinbase is very close to all-time highs. And those are the two big crypto companies as it relates to TradFi. And you have Robinhood making a chain, issuing tokenized stocks. People are very stoked about stable coins, circles through the roof, whereas all of circles, USDC is on Ethereum. And so like previously your and my like bull case would for ETH would be like uncensorable money, uncensorable DeFi, all that kind of stuff. Yeah, he doesn't.
Ryan:
[50:22] Say any of those things.
David:
[50:24] The most pragmatic, the most effective bull case for ETH that I'm seeing like evolve is just like ETH is where stable coins are. ETH is where asset tokenization is. ETH is where all the institutions are making layer twos on. It's just the like there's been like an effort to try and have this like rigorous ETH value capture conversation from the John Charbonneaux's and all those and I'm like intellectually interested in those conversations but then there's just the eh, ETH is just proximate to the bajillions of stable coins and to like the Robinhood chain and the Coinbase chain and to all the other like players that are doing it. And it's just ETH. It's just that's the ETH. It's the institutional asset. And I see like a growing amount of energy. Oh, yeah.
Ryan:
[51:06] It's very it's very left and right of the curve, which makes sense. It's not an overcomplicated narrative. And the stock price is doing pretty well on this, as you might guess. BMNR is the ticker. It jumped about a thousand percent on the back of this news. So doing kind of well on that. Also, Sharplink, of course, which is Joseph Lubin's treasury. Every week, they're doing kind of the microstrategy. It jumped like 38% yesterday. Did it really? Oh, that's nice.
David:
[51:33] Yeah, it went up big. I was like, I guess I didn't see this announcement, but I guess when you announce that you're going to buy 200,000 more ETH, you go up 35%.
Ryan:
[51:40] Well, it also helps when the ETH price jumps, you know, 7%, and then you get an amplifier effect on top of that. So they're just buying every week.
David:
[51:49] We have just been completely Stockholm syndrome as the ETH price movements. We are like, ETH went up like 7%. We're at $2,600 now. Like, hang on, we're going to go up like $300 in a day. And we're going to remember what a true pump is like. We had it not too long ago, but we forget what frothing this can look like in ETH price.
Ryan:
[52:10] Oh, I know. I mean, I made this comment. There's an entire generation lost in crypto who's never felt an actual ETH bull market. And that's why none of them believe that it's happening. And because the last four years, right, from 2022 up to now, if you entered crypto, it's not been great.
David:
[52:27] ETH goes down is what ETH does.
Ryan:
[52:29] ETH goes down.
David:
[52:30] Still on the TradFi side of things, the design app Figma, it has filed to go public. This wouldn't otherwise be news, but they are doing so with $70 million of Bitcoin on the balance sheet. Just moving the Overton window of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset for public
David:
[52:44] companies. So that's pretty cool.
Ryan:
[52:46] That surprised people, right? It's like they're going in public and, oh, we got 70 million on the balance sheet in Bitcoin. Kind of nice. Oh, yeah.
David:
[52:51] By the way, we own a ton of Bitcoin.
Ryan:
[52:55] And then on crypto native news,
David:
[52:56] Coinbase has acquired their fourth company in 2025, Liquify. Liquify is just a token management platform for early stage tokenization process. So if you're going to issue a token and you need compliance, you need token ownership, tracking, vesting, distribution, all that kind of stuff. It's just a compliance platform for token creation. Uniswap Foundation uses it. OP Labs uses it. Athena, Zora, they use it. And now that's integrated into Coinbase. So Coinbase is expanding their suite of offerings.
Ryan:
[53:24] And lastly, this is ZachXBT saying there might be as many as 900 workers in crypto, like maybe some of your co-workers, bankless listeners that aren't who they say they are, that are actually working for North Korea. And they might do something nefarious with your code base, steal your assets. Who knows? And this is these workers have somehow gotten through the interview process.
David:
[53:46] Yeah, between 345 to 920 possible jobs are actually done by North Koreans. Zach alleges that crypto firms have paid at least $16.5 million in salaries to North Korean IT workers since the start of the year. That's wild. Monthly payroll of $2.75 million. Is it really an exploit if you're just working a job?
Ryan:
[54:06] If they're doing good work?
David:
[54:07] They're just working. They haven't gotten fired. Is that an exploit?
Ryan:
[54:13] I mean, taking time bombs. They're definitely looking for exploits.
David:
[54:15] They're definitely looking for exploits, but it seems like they might also just be clocking in to work every day.
Ryan:
[54:21] I don't know, man. But you know how we always talk about crypto is front running the opportunity. It's front running things in general. OK, I think like this type of thing is starting to happen with the AI companies. Do you hear about this Indian worker who is like working for like four or five different firms at the same time?
David:
[54:37] Why was he doing that just to collect salaries?
Ryan:
[54:40] I assume so. Probably. I don't know that it was as nefarious as what we might expect from the North Korean regime. But yeah, that kind of thing. We're just front running things. I mean, this is going to happen all the time. I mean, do you really know who you're working with if you haven't met them in person? We've met.
David:
[54:56] We've met.
Ryan:
[54:57] Yeah.
David:
[54:58] I haven't seen you in a while. You've been off the radar for.
Ryan:
[55:03] A while now. Am I still me?
David:
[55:05] I feel like we need to do a yearly checking. Technology's adapting really quickly. Yeah. Yeah.
Ryan:
[55:09] Some proof of humanity is required. Look, man, I'll just do Sam Altman's WorldCoin thing. I'll get my eyes encoded and we can work from there. All right. One thing I did want to talk to you about is I do think you should
Ryan:
[55:21] go check out this Vitalik Buterin keynote that he gave at ETHCC, David. So I know you missed it, but he had this great line in here, which is talking about the purpose of decentralization. He says, look, the purpose of decentralization is to make users free. And it really brought me back to like, man, he's really good on that subject. He's fantastic on talking about the why we're here type of a subject. And he basically said this. He put up this meme.
Ryan:
[55:48] He's like, first, in the first era of crypto, we're decentralized because we have the top decentralized KOLs as advisor, right? We're decentralized because others believe we're decentralized. And then the next stage is we're decentralized because we use decentralized tech. You know, we have ZK tech and we have cryptography and we're a layer, whatever, and that makes us decentralized, all right? And that's kind of the next level. But now crypto really needs to move to this third level, which is we're decentralized because we make our users free. We have actual like property rights guarantees that if the things disappear, users still have the ability to access their assets. Users still have the ability to move assets from one place to another without any third party interference. Right. And he's like, this is the thing that crypto really needs to focus on now. It's kind of a message to like hey the decentralized theater kind of like that got us here but there's still a lot of that now let's actually do the thing crypto was meant to do which is make our users free sovereign individuals of the internet and i think sometimes we're talking about at least this year for me there's a lot of exciting things going on with stable coins and real world assets and all of these things that are exciting i every once in a while want to get back to the why we're here,
Ryan:
[57:03] Like why we're going bankless, what this is all about, and what the unique thing that crypto is bringing to the world. No one better to talk about that than Vitalik. So I guess I'm just, I'm shilling this episode. Maybe we'll put a little clip from, yeah, I'm shilling the talk. Maybe we'll put a clip from Vitalik in the talk in the moment of Zed, but you got to check this out.
David:
[57:21] Yeah. The link to the talk will also be in the show notes so y'all can go watch it right now.
Ryan:
[57:25] There you go. You all know that crypto is risky. You could lose what you put in, but we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the Bankless journey. Thanks a lot. So basically, you know, level one, we're decentralized because we have the top decentralization KOLs as advisors. Level two, we're decentralized because we use decentralized tech. Level three, we're decentralized because we make our users free. So if you're building something, the first question to ask is, are you making your users free?

2. Robinhood vs. Coinbase: Who Wins the Future of Finance? | David Rodriguez & Omar Kanji
📖 Summary: David Hoffman:
[0:03] We got a pretty timely debate on the podcast today coinbase versus robin hood two competitor companies that are going head to head into the crypto world coinbase of course the incumbent the established crypto native company but robin hood coming right into crypto with pretty big announcements right on the heels of this uh right on the heels of this podcast maybe to kind of just set the
David Hoffman:
[0:27] table before I introduce our two contestants here. We got Robinhood with the ticker hood at $81 billion at the time of recording. It is up 135% year to date. Hood went public in July of 2021, which is not too far off from when Coinbase went public in April of that same year. Coinbase compared to Robinhood's $81 billion is currently coming in at $85 billion and it is up just 30% year to date. But all of that 30% increase year to date has just come within the last 30 days. So while these two competitors, these two financial aspiring super apps are about the same valuation, there has been a little bit of trajectory difference in order to get here.
Omar Kanji:
[1:11] Taking the side of Coinbase,
David Hoffman:
[1:14] We have David from Blockworks. David, welcome to the pod.
David Rodriguez:
[1:17] David, thanks for having me.
David Hoffman:
[1:19] And then taking the side of Robinhood, we have Omar from Dragonfly. Omar, also welcome to the pod.
Omar Kanji:
[1:24] Thank you very much for having me.
David Hoffman:
[1:26] Okay, so Omar, I have been informed that you are the most bullish person on Robinhood that a few people on my timeline know. And then David also respectively, same thing to you with Coinbase. So we're framing this as a debate because I think you guys all have your domain knowledge in the respective companies. I'm sure your knowledge overlaps. We're not counting points here. We're not actually trying to go for a winner. We're trying to build a productive conversation. So we, as myself, because I'm curious about this answer, but then also the listeners as well, can kind of just get a download on the nature of these two businesses. Because I think who wins, or how they win, or really just what the future lies for both of these companies will shape what our industry looks like. Like I said, just two days ago, Robinhood announced their layer two, they launched tokenized stocks.
David Hoffman:
[2:15] And, you know, really, for the first time, putting pressure on Coinbase,
David Hoffman:
[2:19] at least, you know, preliminarily, in order to kind of shape what the future of crypto can look like. My take is that it's nice to have two very strong competitors come into this market. And we'll kind of like suss out what the differences between these companies look like as any advantages that each one has. David, I want to throw it to you first. We'll start with Coinbase. Maybe you could just start us off by giving us a sort of like lay of the land of the Coinbase company. If you popped up in the hood and you looked at where Coinbase makes its money, where the coin valuation comes from and future drivers. Just kind of give us the 101 download that we need to start off with in order to understand Coinbase as a business.
David Rodriguez:
[2:59] Yeah, for sure. Coinbase has been around for at least this point, 13 plus years. Obviously, it started out as a Bitcoin fiat on-ramp in the United States. Over the past few years, as it's evolved to a full-stack, I would say, on-chain brokerage with various financial services, really the premier US-based exchange in the United States. Obviously, it's expanding globally today with Coinbase International, Coinbase Derivatives.
David Rodriguez:
[3:26] Today, the business generates a majority of its revenue from transaction revenue or transaction fees or trading fees on its Coinbase platform, on its Coinbase exchange. But it increasingly has leaned into subscriptions and services through Coinbase One and also StablePoint rewards with its partnership through Circle, which is the second largest StablePoint in the on-chain economy today.
David Rodriguez:
[3:51] Coinbase has done a really good job, I think in the depths of the bear last cycle, of diversifying its revenue stream. It was heavily weighted towards trading volume and trading fees in general. So in bear markets, like we've seen in this very cyclical industry, it can have peaked the trombs of 80% revenue declines. But I think it's done a very good job as of the past few years through its USDC partnership, I'd say increasing the floor of how much revenue it can generate throughout bear and bull cycles. But now it's taking on a new life. It is not just the premier exchange in the United States. It does not just have its relationship with Circle. It is now becoming, I would say, a full stack infrastructure provider for moving the entire world's economy on chain. Over the past year or so, they've launched Wallet as a Service. They've launched more recently over the past two, three weeks during their product announcement, they launched Crypto as a Service and Coinbase Business. What I see Coinbase today becoming is instead of just a front end or like a thin front end for
David Rodriguez:
[4:57] The economy coming on chain, it's now becoming like the back end. It's more trying to become like the AWS. They will not win the distribution game compared to TradFi incumbents or even a Robinhood coming on chain. What they're trying to be is a B2B platform is where I think the company is going forward looking to offer services to help other players come on chain. And they already have pretty mainstream adoption as custody providers for major ETFs. And they already have over 200 institutions leveraging its crypto as a service platform to tap into Coinbase's backend infrastructure to offer digital asset
David Rodriguez:
[5:32] services to their customer base.
David Hoffman:
[5:34] Omar, before we get into that same kind of prompt with Robinhood, what comes to mind when you're listening to David give his kind of like lay of the land for Coinbase? He talked about not really actually going toe to toe with distribution. He talked about kind of being a backend. What stood out to you?
Omar Kanji:
[5:48] Yeah, I think from all David's comments and everything I know about the company. I think what they have managed to do, so much to his point, is build a best-in-class crypto infrastructure platform that offers a fully end-to-end service for retail customers and institutions. And if that is the framework for the business, I think it is a great point to leverage all of their institutional know-how and all of their tech that they've built into this next leg of growth for the company, which is going to look materially different than it has the last 10 years. And so I think he encapsulated it really well. And I think they come from a really strong place with a lot of things and a lot of pieces of the puzzle already in place. And now it's just like, what does that go to market look like over the next 10, 15 years?
David Hoffman:
[6:33] From the crypto side of things, Coinbase has always had the golden goose of distribution inside of crypto. And I'm hearing both of you kind of agree that Coinbase is more, It's going to keep its, you know, retail trading base. It's going to keep its like front end on ramps. You know, that's how I get my money into crypto when I need to do that. But it sounds like you guys are both aligned in the nature that Coinbase is going to refocus itself towards less distribution and more towards just kind of, you know, back-end logic, business management, services towards companies, services towards corporations, and kind of being like the on-chain service provider to whatever that means in a variety of different contexts for the pre-existing institutions out there. Would you guys agree with that kind of encapsulation? What would you change? David, I'll throw it to you.
David Rodriguez:
[7:20] Yeah, I would directionally agree. I think they're going to try to walk and chew gum at the same time. I think they're still going to try to grow their distribution. They already made a buy for launching tokenized stocks. I believe I saw something a couple weeks ago talking to CFTC or the SEC about getting illegalized in the US. I think they're going to try to grow their distribution platform or grow their distribution as a centralized exchange and a brokerage or an on-chain brokerage firm. I do think though that the revenue composition of the business forward-looking though is largely going to come from the backend infrastructure service that they're going to provide for businesses. But I think I'd be bearish if they didn't continue to try to grow their distribution. I just think that it might be an uphill battle compared to the likes of Robinhood or the JP Morgan's Bank of America's of the world that are inevitably going to come on chain.
David Hoffman:
[8:09] Maybe you could shine a little bit more light on that part of the business, David. What does that look like, that B2B service?
Omar Kanji:
[8:16] What are some
David Hoffman:
[8:16] Of the products there? What can you say about the margins? What can you say about the growth? What can you say about really just the aspirations that Coinbase has in that sector?
David Rodriguez:
[8:24] Yeah, I think it's very early still to know what the margins are going to look like. They just launched Crypto as a Service through Scarlett at least publicly announced it. They came with 200 plus institutions that are using it.
David Hoffman:
[8:35] What's Crypto as a Service? What is that?
David Rodriguez:
[8:37] Yeah, so they're going to be offering the ability for fintechs and financial institutions to offer digital asset trading, custody services, and maybe potential other financial services that they're already messing around with. Let's say like the Morpho integration with taking out mortgages or taking out loans through Morpho in the back end. TBD on exactly what that looks like. But at a high level, they're going to be offering digital asset custody trading solutions. So what I imagine is Coinbase is like the back-end exchange. And then JP Morgan wants to offer digital asset trading for their customers or Morgan Stanley does. And what you don't know is like you're trading and you're buying and selling or even custodying your Bitcoin or whatever asset on Morgan Stanley or on that front end. But in the back-end, it's actually Coinbase's exchange infrastructure, custody infrastructure, even payments infrastructure. So they launched Coinbase Business, which I think is more of like a mom and pop or proof of sale or POS offering for merchants. They obviously launched their announcement with Shopify. One of the more interesting things that I think that they launched two weeks ago that I think was under discussed is I think it's called the Coinbase Commerce Protocol.
David Rodriguez:
[9:46] Effectively, what it is, it's like a generalized payment solution that's launched on base. And getting into the more technical details of it, it actually looks like it has the opportunity to just intermediate Visa and MasterCard, where it's going to allow large big box retailers, the Amazons, Walmarts of the world that have these huge ecosystems to effectively become their own credit card issuer. And they're going to be able to tailor their own logic to know how their user base is going to be allowed to use chargebacks or different reward systems for users that are inside their economy or their ecosystem. But TLDR, it's still very early to know exactly what this looks like. But I think that they have the distribution with businesses, the brand, and also the know-how to know where they need to grow their business lines as an infrastructure player.
David Hoffman:
[10:33] Omar, I'm seeing you nod your head. What did you like about that? What did you agree with? Give us a little bit more color.
Omar Kanji:
[10:38] I think it was all very well said. I would say just going back to one of the earlier parts with respect to is it purely going to be an institutional platform? I think to some of the stuff that David spoke about, they're still very much leaning into base as the ecosystem for retail going forward. I do not think that's going away anytime soon. I think they fully intend on building that out based on everything that they've said, all the product launches that they have planned, all the protocols and things that they're incubating over there. It is certainly a big part of their business going forward. And then the other thing I would add is on the stablecoin front, USDC distribution is something that is obviously bootstrapped with Coinbase Commerce, what David
Omar Kanji:
[11:20] Getting USDC into the pockets of a number of people around the world, leveraging base, leveraging the Coinbase wallet, all of these different pieces of infrastructure that they've built over time is a big part of their strategy as well. And I think similar to what David said earlier, it's not truly going to be transaction revenue as the primary monetization vector for the business over time. There will be this B2B component. There will also be this happy consumer payments angle. There will also be business payments that go along with it. And then if you tack on base and the whole consumer ecosystem, it starts to give you a better sense of what the business looks like five years out. And then the last piece I would add would be they're still trying to integrate the whole on-chain economy into the Coinbase platform as well. And you see that with the DEX integrations that they have or that they're working on to integrate all the range of DEX tokens. And I think their view is just to make everything that you can trade on-chain tradable on Coinbase, the platform. And like, that's what the business ends up looking like, in addition to all the B2B stuff over time.
David Rodriguez:
[12:23] The last thing that's a kind of the call option on Coinbase is like also Coinbase Ventures, right? They're like one of the largest VC firms in the entire industry. You know, that's very much not discussed today. And like, we already see how well Circle did when it IPO'd the industry or, you know, Wall Street clearly wants crypto equity exposure. I have to imagine a lot of their VC portfolio is based in tokens, but I'm sure a good amount of it is also in crypto companies that plan on IPO-ing in the other competitors don't have, is worth a lot of money over the next five to 10 years.
David Hoffman:
[13:02] Yeah, I guess it's hard to ask you to give a valuation on what is fundamentally a VC portfolio. It's like, really, you can't really do that. But if you had to do that to compare that to Coinbase's revenue, how do you compare apples to oranges here, if we're trying to compare sizes?
David Rodriguez:
[13:17] Yeah, I mean, I would not. Actually, I don't know, Omar, you might be more versed in that subject but i i
Omar Kanji:
[13:24] No to your point there hasn't been enough disclosure around like the size of their holdings and what they're marked at to like really have a good sense like we we all have a good idea on the names that are in there but we have no idea the amount of money and so so it's really hard we don't know how
David Hoffman:
[13:39] Much they raised.
Omar Kanji:
[13:40] I my understanding is that it's all balance sheet capital but i don't know if there's any external lps i'm not sure so i
David Rodriguez:
[13:46] Don't believe there is but i don't think they're even publicly
Omar Kanji:
[13:49] Disclosed okay
David Hoffman:
[13:50] So it's a true dark horse so maybe we could just like fairly guess somewhere in $100 million of like total investment into this thing. I think we're just kind of like blindly throwing darts here. It seems maybe around there. And then, you know, in the optimistic scenario, you know, you get a 10x, 15x, 20x over the longest of terms, it starts to come in at like 1 to 2 billion. These are just my rough napkin maths. Maybe Omar, you would disagree. But if it's a 1 to 2 billion dollar valuation, I don't think that's moving the needle too much on what is a currently an $85 billion valuation on coin stock. That's my logic. Omar, check me on that.
Omar Kanji:
[14:25] Yeah, no, I think that sounds like reasonable. I'm sure if we dug around the financials, we could see like what they haven't booked out in like some of the disclosure there. So, but you know, off the top of my head saying that it's between like worth one to five billion somewhere in that wheelhouse, depending, that's probably high to be quite honest, like It probably skews closer to a billion, but yeah, I mean, it sounds reasonable.
David Rodriguez:
[14:49] Yeah, unclear to me, to be honest.
David Hoffman:
[14:52] I'm not sure. We'll treat that as a cherry on top. Let me go back to kind of the backend infrastructure angle, and then we'll turn to Omar to lead the Robinhood section. It sounds to me that like Coinbase is packaging up their, their strategy is to package up their software, package up their exchange, package up their, you know, I don't know if it's, if it's right, but USDC on base as a Visa competitor, along with some of that, that logic and really, you know, start duplicating some of the efforts that they have already made building Coinbase in the first place. And then, you know, allowing Fidelity to like slot that right into the back end of their brokerage or really any sort of, you know, entity who's like, oh, you know, crypto is real. We are, we now need to serve crypto to our clients. Do we need to build an exchange or can we just like hook in some, I don't know, SDK, I don't know if that's the right technical term, but just like allow some sort of integration of what is effectively the Coinbase backend, but it's whitelisted for Fidelity customers or TD Ameritrade customers. And that's a very good distribution strategy, as I understand it, rather than going in the trenches, going individual customer by individual customer, they're just going to brokerages and getting all of their customers in at once. I would imagine they're charging those customers lower fees in order to make that work. But on an aggregate basis, when you add everything together, then if you just acquire all of the trading demand of every single brokerage that the greatest Coinbase in the backend on their software products. Sounds like a pretty strong arena of growth to me. David, check me on that.
David Rodriguez:
[16:21] Yeah, I agree. I mean, I think maybe not one-to-one parallel, but looking at AWS as a business, it's extremely high margin. Amazon built AWS largely for their internal purposes in the early 2000s. And they realized, look, every startup in the world, every business in the world is not going to want to have their own on-prem server or on-prem compute. And why not try white label it or why not try to offer that as a service? And I think the same can be said for you know, back in infrastructure for crypto. Yeah, some firms will want to bring that in-house. I imagine maybe Robinhood might be one of those folks that want to do that because they have the chops to do it. Maybe some fintech and tradified firms might want to bring that in-house as well. But I think a large majority of businesses that want to come on chain will not. They will outsource that because it's cheaper. They don't have the technical experience. And the reality is like, cussing crypto is extremely risky, right? Like even the larger centralized exchanges in the world have gotten hacked before, a la like Bybit and other centralized exchanges and other major protocols before. Coinbase has proven that they have a trusted and secure brand.
David Rodriguez:
[17:22] Security as a crypto business has been operating for 12, 13 plus years. And they know what the friction points are because they have themselves been moving more on-chain as a business over the past decade. And I think they know exactly what the innate pain points are to offer a really nice package service to other companies in the future. So I have to imagine long term, it's going to be a very high margin of business. But yeah, I think it's akin to AWS, maybe not exact parallels, but that's how I have my mental framework for. So Coinbase to me, like the thesis for Coinbase, if I can sum it up in one sentence, is the entire world moving on chain. Like it is the pure play of the on chain economy growing.
David Hoffman:
[18:05] Yeah, I also enjoy the notion of if Coinbase is integrating things like Morpho or Dex aggregation directly in their front end, well, that too can also get packaged up, put in a piece of software, integrated into TDMA trade. And if it's providing a value to Coinbase's customers, then it can also provide a value to any generalized brokerage that integrates Coinbase. And then Coinbase just becomes the conduit for TradFi customers and assets and logic to touch the chain pretty seamlessly with that Coinbase brand. Okay, so I feel like this conversation is pretty young in the Coinbase world. There's starting to be some brewing conversations about it, but there's a lot of work to be done. It's a big sector of growth that Coinbase is just at the starting line for. I feel like we've covered that pretty well. There's other parts of Coinbase growth there. Go ahead, Arma, what do you want to say? No, the only thing I would add.
Omar Kanji:
[18:55] To the Coinbase infrastructure play is like similar to what we discussed, there's always this option, which is like buy versus build. And a lot of the time companies don't want to build this stuff internally because they don't have the expertise. You end up having to hire, you end up having to go outside the organization, bring the talent in-house, and then ultimately you end up trying to build a product. You have to test that product. And that's like a whole time lag, especially when crypto is relatively time sensitive today.
Omar Kanji:
[19:24] And so a lot of companies do want to outsource this and use an infrastructure provider. That being said, I think one of the big challenges for Coinbase with this play, and not to push back on it, but I do think that there is an inherent tension between Coinbase's retail business and this exchange infrastructure as a service business, because ultimately, the profits that they do make from the exchange as a service business end up going back to funding their operations, which then they use to fund incentives to then try and bring customers into the retail side of their business and get them onto base and the whole range of transaction activity. And so, you know, some potential customers of Coinbase or even Kraken's institutional offering, they definitely think twice, I would say, about who they're going to give their business to. And we've kind of seen some of the infrastructure providers, whether it's on the staking side or the custody side, go and pitch directly, as opposed to getting the bundle from an exchange itself, who they're going to compete with for those same customers. So that's the only thing I'd say in, unlike the things to just think about for anyone that's looking at that side of the business, because there is a tension and Coinbase does compete with all of these platforms. Like they rightfully should. It's the one of the highest margin parts of their business for those customers.
David Hoffman:
[20:43] So David, there's, we could talk about USDC income into Coinbase. We could talk about base on-chain revenues in terms of just like kind of understanding the future growth of Coinbase. I feel like we've laid down the, you know, back end to TradFi thesis pretty well. What's worth adding to that list of growth venues for Coinbase before we wrap up the Coinbase out of this conversation?
David Rodriguez:
[21:04] I mean, they're making 60% of Circle's revenue, right? And like, it's still very early. It's very early days for stablecoins.
David Hoffman:
[21:12] How locked in is that? Is that just a permanent part of the circle deal? Is that going anywhere?
David Rodriguez:
[21:17] I believe, and I might be misspeaking slightly, but I believe that it is subject, it is up for renewal at the end of 2026. But Coinbase pretty much has say in any material changes to the contract. So for example, that partnership circle did with Binance to hold, I think they had to hold like 1 billion USDC on Binance's dollar sheet and then they have a revenue share agreement with Binance. Circle had to go to Coinbase to get their approval in order to allow that to happen. Obviously, that's in the terms of this current contract. But my understanding is it's effectively a perpetual contract, but
David Rodriguez:
[21:57] There is room for negotiation at the end of 2026. Again, might be misspeaking there slightly, but I think the power is definitely in Coinbase's hands. So look, it's very early days for stable coins. That is not to say the stable coins of today are going to be the stable coins of tomorrow. Obviously, we probably talk about Global USD, which is Robinhood's consortium stable coin. We talk about PayPal USD and even JP Morgan trying to tokenize deposits on base and what have you. It's like every fintech company or every bank that is anyone will try to get into the stablecoin game. And over time, that will be a low margin, very highly competitive business. But Circle is the largest regulated USDC stablecoin in the US economy today. And I don't see that changing anytime soon. And if anything, stablecoin and USDC market cap is probably going to 10x over the next two to three years, I'd be surprised if it didn't. And even with future rate cuts, that is going to be a large material revenue driver for Coinbase. So that's also, I think, like a major thing that I think everyone has already baked into, you know, maybe not into their valuation today, but everyone is already cognizant of that revenue share agreement. And it just like, it's a really stable, I think, income stream for them to continue to, you know, build out base, build out their trading infrastructure, build out their Coinbase, their crypto as a service offering.
David Hoffman:
[23:14] As I understand it, Circle pays the operating expenses after Coinbase takes their 50% cut. So like Coinbase feels like they got a really sweet deal taking a lot of it's all profit for coinbase they don't have to pay for any of the employees or any of the anything else that's my that's my understanding is that correct i.
David Rodriguez:
[23:32] Believe that's correct i mean they definitely they max extracted on that one for
Omar Kanji:
[23:36] Sure yeah yeah like the broth the rough calculation is coinbase gets all the interest income of usdc held on their platform and then it's a 50 50 split on the rest
David Hoffman:
[23:46] Like on the rest.
Omar Kanji:
[23:47] And get 100
David Hoffman:
[23:48] Of everything that's on their platform and 50 of the rest that is a sweet deal yeah.
Omar Kanji:
[23:53] That's like the rough calculus there's nuances to like where usdc's held and circle has a portion that they retain on their own but it's relatively small but uh that's that's the mental model for how to think about it and it was funny because at one point circle had flipped coinbase last week which is kind of counterintuitive when one company makes more off a product than the other does all
David Hoffman:
[24:12] Right that is but the market is correct, Right, right, right. David, there's a base revenue from transaction fees. Coinbase is a Bitcoin custodian. Any last subjects that are worth touching on for sources of future Coinbase revenue? Yeah.
David Rodriguez:
[24:28] I mean, I think there's so many different revenue streams that are non-material today that I think will be in the future, base revenue obviously being one of them. But I think the listeners today were going to take away something. I think it's, look, they have a high stable revenue stream come from stable coin rewards with their partnership with Circle. They make a material amount of their revenue from trading fees. I don't see those two changing for the foreseeable future. But there's all these other things, largely their infrastructure as a service offering for the on-chain economy growing or bringing on fintechs and traditional banks into the on-chain economy. That, I think, is going to be just a more material portion of their revenue over the next three to five years. And I think will, over time, become the majority of their revenue, if my thesis is correct. So that's a yes. But yeah, there's a bunch of other service lines that are not, you know, staking rewards, right? Like they're the largest institutional staker in the entire industry at this point. Couldn't even tell you how many tens of billions of dollars they have under their management.
David Hoffman:
[25:32] But yeah, as I really understand all of this revenue sources, it doesn't seem that competitive with Robinhood. It seems pretty differentiated as a product line. Now I think we can kind of extrapolate into the future and be like, yeah, eventually these two giants will like butt up against each other. As it stands today, it feels like the product lines and where they get their revenue are pretty like at harmony, at peace with each other and not actually going toe to toe. That's my understanding. Omar, check me on that take.
Omar Kanji:
[25:58] Yeah, you're right. But happy to go into it whenever or when we talk about Robinhood. Yeah, let's do it.
David Hoffman:
[26:03] Yeah. So give us give us that same kind of lay of the land. What's the current state of Robinhood? Where do they get their money from? And then we'll touch on vehicles for growth.
Omar Kanji:
[26:10] Yeah, maybe just like going back in time to kick it off. Sure. So Robinhood was founded at a similar point in time to Coinbase back in 2013.
Omar Kanji:
[26:19] And it was founded by Vlad Tenev and Bajubai. And they both had met at Stanford. And initially, they were working on HFT software that they were selling institutions over time that ended up pivoting and they ended up building a retail first platform. And they had like two key insights that had driven a lot of their decision making at that time. They were of the view that the world was going to be mobile and that retail users didn't want to pay fees. And that was the core premise of the business at the time, which was we are going to build a really slick, intuitive user interface that people can use to trade on their phones. They can get all the relevant information and they don't need to pay fees. And the world's youngest generation, which is like a big part of the Robinhood story, this is going to be the way they live. Everything will be mobile first and native. And that is what they want to do. And so the Robinhood story started back then. And over time, it has just been a compounding growth story in terms of users. And so if you rewind the clock a little bit, if you go back to 2017, they had 2 million users. If you go up to 2020, they had 12.5 million funded accounts. And then if you go to today, it's a business that has 26 million users. And for context, the US population is roughly 340 million people. And so they're just under 10% of the US.
Omar Kanji:
[27:41] But it has been like a story that has been built on the back of like, what does the next generation of investing products look like? And that's the way they started. And that's the way they built their business over time. And as Robinhood today, so the way to think about it is there's $256 billion of assets on the platform across these 26 million roughly funded accounts, which means there's roughly $10,000 balance per account on the platform is a very simple way to think about it. The platform itself does like $3 billion of revenue. And the bulk of that, so like half of it comes from transaction-based revenue. And then the vast majority of the rest comes from interest income. Now, interest income isn't to be construed the exact same way as it is with USDC, but it tends to be the large chunk of that is margin-based interest. Then there's some CashSweep. There's a range of other interest products, but largely Robinhood operates off of a trading fee-based model, which they, similar to Coinbase, are trying to diversify over time.
Omar Kanji:
[28:48] And I think for the listeners that aren't that familiar with this story, the big thing that they did to have no trading fees directly was a concept called payment for order flow. And what payment for order flow is, is market makers will pay you for price insensitive flow effectively, which is I'm a retail order. I put in an order to buy one Bitcoin. They give me a quote and they will pay me for that quote. They'll go execute it and they'll execute it across a range of different venues. And there tends to be a spread in there, which is why they're paying you for that flow. And Robinhood gets a portion of that. Robinhood gets what they are paid for that flow. And so like, that's kind of how the business model works, which is payment forward flow. And that's how they make the revenue. So unlike Coinbase, which is direct fee, then it gets executed on the back end. It's just slightly different, but there's still a revenue model associated with it.
Omar Kanji:
[29:41] And so that's like roughly what like the business looks like today. And if you were to just like, kind of break out, okay, like, of the of their transaction brace revenues, like where does crypto fit into this whole piece of the pie? Today, the half of their business effectively is options with, you know, if you look back to 2024, it's like 760 million, I think is the number. And then if you look at crypto, crypto $630 million roughly. And then if you look at traditional equities, just like buying NVIDIA or SpaceX or Tesla, that's $177 million. And so that's the way to kind of think about the business. Historically, crypto has been relatively small. If you go back to 2019, I believe they made $10 million off of crypto. And so the crypto story has been a relatively new in the broader Robinhood story vector for growth. And it's been something that they've leaned into really, really heavily in recent years. But the Robinhood story for most people out there has been one of traditional financial products. And I think that's probably the easiest way to think about Robinhood's revenues and broad business today. But there's a huge other component, which is part of my whole thesis on the
Omar Kanji:
[31:02] business, which I'm happy to get into. But I'll just pause there and talk about it.
David Hoffman:
[31:05] And I think that was great. I want to talk about the two big events that Robinhood has had this year. The one just happened to catch a token that was a crypto event. And then maybe three months ago, they did more of like a traditional finance event where they introduced Robinhood banking, the Robinhood credit card. So that's kind of like they're more, you know, more, you know, trad fi, not crypto, but, you know, retail forward, you know, retail banking and trying to, it looks like to become a full stack financial company. I'm guessing if we're going to talk about venues for growth in Robinhood, they're going to come from these two announcements, which is like very convenient that we have these two like announcements to talk about. So I'll throw it back to you and give us a broad thesis. And then we'll go into those individual announcements.
Omar Kanji:
[31:46] Yeah. So like my thesis on it is Robinhood is building the multi-generational financial super app for our generation. And they were brilliant in the sense that they went after the youngest cohort of customers with their initial product back in 2013. And if you like, just think about it, 10 years ago or 12 years ago, all of us were much younger.
Omar Kanji:
[32:10] And, you know, we probably had a lot less money and, you know, we were probably starting out our careers.
Omar Kanji:
[32:16] And they went right after this cohort of customers that was young, didn't want to pay fees, but was on their phone.
Omar Kanji:
[32:22] And over the last 12 years, they've managed to grow with them. And at the same time, they've added cohorts sequentially of younger and younger and younger customers. And if you look at the population of Robinhood's customer base, 75% is under the age of 44, roughly. And so you have this platform that skews really young, that's really active on their phones, and that trades luck. And what does this generation want to do? They want to do everything off their phones. I don't want to go into a bank branch. I don't want to go deposit checks at the teller. I don't want to go to an ATM to pull out cash. I want to literally do everything from my phone. And so Vlad, what he's trying to build is like stage one of Robinhood was like, I'm going to build like this great active trading platform, which they continue to do and we can talk about. But like the next arc for Robinhood is like the all-in-one super app for your everyday needs. And similar to what David mentioned earlier, it's like, this is where Robinhood Gold comes in. And for people that aren't familiar, that's their subscription program. And through Robinhood Gold, and they have a Robinhood Gold card, what this allows you to do is use Robinhood for your day-to-day spending. And that comes with a 3% cash back, which can be redeemed in the app. It allows you to get matches on retirement accounts. It allows you to get a cash sweep in your Robinhood account. It allows you to have margin interest production fees, all kinds of different benefits that they are enveloping into a full stack financial services platform that covers your day-to-day needs.
Omar Kanji:
[33:50] And so whether you want to spend day-to-day at Chipotle, whether you want to deposit money in the bank, which you'll be able to do over time through their bank partners, whether you want to trade equities like Tesla or NVIDIA or what have you, you can do that directly on the platform. Whether you want to buy crypto, you can do that directly through the platform as well. If you want to punt on options, you can do that. Now they've obviously integrated contract markets. And so if you want to have Robinhood prediction market offerings, you can do that directly through Robinhood as well. And so you can kind of see the whole Robinhood story, which is, I'm going to grow with this cohort of customers. They're going to get richer and wealthier over time. And I'm going to sandwich them with the full range of financial products so that they don't need to go anywhere else. They can use me for literally everything. And I think that is like the part of the product that I, or the part of the business that I'm like the most bullish on, because like, I see it with everyone my age. I see it with people under a younger me and even some of the people that are older. It's just, everyone wants consolidation. I don't want to use a credit card from Amex. I don't want to bank with Chase. I don't want to do all of these things across all of these different places and have 10 different accounts. I want everything to be mobile first and tailored and optimized to the way I conduct my day-to-day life with like extremely limited friction.
Omar Kanji:
[35:09] And Robinhood is certainly going in that direction. And I think when you think
Omar Kanji:
[35:13] about the crypto part of the business, that's where it fits in. It's like our generation is younger. We recognize the importance of crypto, how big of a role it's going to play in society. And it's a great way for them to continue to sandwich these users with the full stack of financial service offerings. But I will pause there. I've gone on for a little bit, but yeah, we can talk about anything.
David Hoffman:
[35:32] I think that was beautifully articulated. I re-downloaded Robinhood. I initially got into investing, like I think many people here, through Robinhood, even before crypto, like right out of college for me. It was like two years before I got into crypto and I was owning like semiconductors. I was owning like 2x long semiconductors because I really like risk. Then I left Robinhood because I got into crypto and so I didn't touch Robinhood for years. But then it was sometime during like the last bear market in 2022, 2023, and we were all looking at coin at like $30. And I was like, well, you know what, I'm going to buy some coin. And so I redownloaded Robinhood for the first time. And that's where I got my first coin shares. And in that process, I was thinking, oh, where do I even go to buy equities? Oh, yeah, I can download Robinhood. And I was thinking in that moment, if it wasn't Robinhood, where else would I go? And I thought, yeah, I guess I could do a TD Ameritrade. I could do a Fidelity. But that just... Doesn't feel right at all. That just feels so boomer. So Omar, the question is, who is Robin Hood's competition? I know there's pre-established brokerages that already have their base, but I couldn't think of a single alternative that was interesting to me as a millennial who just wanted a basic exposure to spot stocks.
Omar Kanji:
[36:48] Yeah. I mean, it looks like all of the people that you know, which is the Fidelities of the world, the E-Trades of the world, the Ameritrades of the world. And IBKRs of the world, like every traditional broker is kind of who they're competing against. But our generation kind of has this tech first approach, I would say. It's like, we want something that's super simple, easy, not hard to onboard onto, which Robinhood abstracts so much of the pain away. And then once you're on there, you want it to be super simple and like relatively few clicks before you're buying an equity. And so like, all of the traditional brokers is who they are competing against is the way I think about it, especially in the US. And you know they compete against the banks more directly on like where they're going with the business today but uh all of the boomer products that you can think of is who they compete with
David Hoffman:
[37:36] Right and i can't imagine any of them are innovating or growing nearly at the rate of speed that robin hood is.
Omar Kanji:
[37:41] Yeah this plays into the other into david's thesis which it which is the exchange infrastructure as a service play i'm going to this which is like everyone recognizes is what's going on. And they're like, okay, I need to provide these customers with the full range of financial services offerings. Crypto is certainly one of them. And so like, how do I get that into my platform so I don't lose them to Robinhood? And it's exactly the reason we've seen Robinhood's accounts grow from 2 million in 2017 to 26 million today. It's just like people are looking for somewhere to do everything in one place. And Robinhood is arguably one of the best places to do that.
David Hoffman:
[38:17] David, when you hear Omar's thesis about Robinhood, what do you like? Anything you disagree with? Anything that you think Coinbase can actually push up against Robinhood with their future aspirations?
David Rodriguez:
[38:28] I love Robinhood. I'm a user. I'm a power user. I know I'm supposed to be a coin bullet here, but Robinhood is a great company. It is a masterclass on product strategy.
David Rodriguez:
[38:39] Whoever their product team is, every single Web2, Web3 company should be trying to post them because it's a beautiful app. It's so easy to use. It's simple. My first foray into investing very much like yourself, David, and I'm sure Omar as well, maybe was downloading Robinhood back in mid-2014, 2015, right out of college and just messing around with options. It was just so simple. As someone that did not do any prior investing prior to that, in my college days, it was investing for dummies. And they made it so simple. But they have obviously large aspirations. And they've done a killer job with their product. They've done a great job with Robinhood Gold. I think what Coinbase can learn from is product first.
David Rodriguez:
[39:28] I don't love Coinbase's main app. It is clunky. I would argue that maybe it's gotten a little better over the past year or so. But it does not have a cohesive... It doesn't feel like a mobile-first app, even though it probably is. But it doesn't feel like it. I can't easily buy and sell assets in the same user interface that I'm used to or accustomed to with Robinhood. I think Coinbase is going to learn a lot from the product and user experience side. But I mean, I largely agree with everything Omar said. They are the millennial, Gen Z, and future generational, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley.
David Rodriguez:
[40:13] They're killing it. And I think what Coinbase I don't know if Coinbase has the product chops, candidly, to be able to compete with Robinhood in that arena. But I think they do have the chops to do and the expertise on is everything in the back end. Don't get me wrong, they should absolutely still go toe-to-toe with Robinhood becoming a financial super app. And I think they're obviously trying to make strides in that. They see obviously the future of subscriptions. Gen Z's millennials love paying for subscriptions. So they launched Coinbase One, where you get pretty much free training on the app. You obviously can now get the Coinbase credit card, which is very similar to a Robinhood that would have a Robinhood gold. So they're definitely converging on the same offering for retail and B2C strategy. But I think where Coinbase is differentiating is obviously more on the B2B side.
Omar Kanji:
[41:00] Yeah, maybe just one of the things I want to add for the listeners is on the Robinhood side, in 21, there was an existential crisis for the business. And I'm sure many people that are listening probably remember it. But the whole GameStop saga. And I think one of the things, and to draw a parallel back to crypto maybe, is the Maple and Euler stories of this year, which have been like two incredible comeback stories. Robinhood just had like its own version of that in 2021. People hated Robinhood. And if you went on to WallStreetBets on Reddit and you went and like checked out any of the comments, people were seething at that. They despised it. And I think there is certainly something to be said for the businesses that can survive existential crises.
Omar Kanji:
[41:50] Rebuild, and come back stronger than ever. And at the same time, have their customers be some of their loudest supporters and sources of referrals. And if we look back in the history of time, I do think Robinhood's 21 crash will be looked back at as one of the defining moments in its history, which is it survived what could have been the end of the business. And it came back stronger than ever with a reinvigorated product strategy that changed the arc of like what this business is going to look like for the next 10, 15 years. And so I think it's like worth noting that just because like resilient management teams as an indicator for good businesses, you don't necessarily see that too often. And so I think it's worth just noting.
David Hoffman:
[42:36] Yeah, I'd actually like to learn a little bit more about that because to this day, Robinhood's brand still has echoes of that GameStop event. Like when I posted the recent interview with Vlad I did. I had like a, I mean, you get reply guys on Twitter of all shapes and sizes, so there shouldn't be any sort of a particular surprise to anyone. But like somebody was like, oh, Vlad's corrupt because they yoinked the sell button on GameStop. And so, you know, there's some leftover notes left from that PR crisis back in 2021. Now that we have like four years of hindsight behind us, I don't really know the true details of what happened. The accusation towards Robin Hood was that they yoinked the sell button because the guy from Citadel called them up and it was like, hey, or no, there's the buy button. They yoinked the buy button because the guy from Citadel called them up and it was corruption. And then there was like rebuttal from Robin Hood that I don't really remember the nuances, but there was like a seemingly just like perfectly valid explanation for this that no one really wanted to hear. That's my understanding.
David Hoffman:
[43:36] I'm probably I think listeners are about probably where I am. Omar, do you have any more clarity about what happened and if Robin Hood was vindicated or not, or maybe there was corruption? I don't really know the details. What can you say?
Omar Kanji:
[43:48] Yeah, you're pushing the limits of my recall. But I would say that My understanding still is with all of the GameStop volatility, Robinhood had to come up with tens of billions of dollars, if I'm not mistaken, to post with the DTCC, if I'm not mistaken. And they did not have access to that amount of money at the time. And so what they ultimately end up having to do was just restrict trading. And it was largely a function of the regulators requiring them to post capital as opposed to anything like nefarious on their end and obviously like that impacted retail the most and a lot of people that were bidding on the run-up didn't have the ability to sell the stock because of like these crazy capital capital requirements that Robinhood had to come up with and so just turned into a PR nightmare which right ultimately ended up being like oh Robinhood is going after me and their hands were tied and there wasn't really anything they could do. I think the messaging could have been much better and they could have been much clearer at the time if I'm, you know, recalling everything perfectly. But yeah, it was a function of capital requirements as opposed to anything nefarious.
David Hoffman:
[45:01] Right. Right. Yeah. That's my loose understanding as well. One thing I want to touch on, because this will start to bring up some pretty good comparing and contrasting between Robinhood and Coinbase is Robinhood's announced banking platform that is coming, I think, in like Q3 or Q4 of this year, they are just announcing the fact that they can become a bank. And so retail customers can just deposit money in the Robinhood banking platform, which you would think has a very thin wall between their brokerage equity stock platform, something that Coinbase does not have because Coinbase still has banking partners that it needs to bank with. Robinhood itself is a bank. What kind of advantages does Robinhood being a bank give Robinhood over Coinbase, or is that not really much of one?
Omar Kanji:
[45:45] My understanding is that they're not actually going to become a bank. They're going to use banking partners. I could be mistaken, but even if you look at their credit card, they're using Coastal. If they become a bank, there's just a lot, first off, it takes a lot of time. And second, there's a lot more regulation from a capital perspective. Now you have various amounts of capital that you have to post across different tiers to maintain your status with the OCC. And all of the different bank regulators that there are in the U.S. And so Robita doesn't want to do that, but they want to become a financial technology company. And I'm sure at some point down the road, they will arguably try and become a bank. But today, from my understanding, their strategy is to become a bank service provider. And the way you can kind of see it, even on the mortgage side, they're not the one providing the mortgage directly. They're sourcing mortgage rates for you to then switch your mortgage over, which then they get paid for versus underwriting every single new mortgage application on the platform.
David Hoffman:
[46:41] Okay, so they're still more operating as a portal. They're a front end for a different bank that they are just managing for users. Okay, that makes more sense. Let's
David Hoffman:
[46:50] get into some of the things that are definitely running up head to head. So Robinhood just announced the Robinhood chain. They also announced tokenized stocks, which I think is one of the more exciting things that we've seen in crypto, perhaps since the Bitcoin ETF. I can't really think of another thing that was more exciting, more new for crypto since that. Coinbase, maybe two or three weeks ago, filed some requests with the SEC for a regulatory sandbox for tokenized stocks. So you know Coinbase is eyeing this as well. Robinhood, I mean, it's just an announcement, but you can kind of see Robinhood beating Coinbase to the punch in tokenized stocks. And then also the tokenized private equities like SpaceX and OpenAI, I think is extremely exciting to people, only available for EU citizens because of compliance. But nonetheless, you are now seeing Robinhood chain being announced, which of course goes up toe to toe against base. Both Coinbase and Robinhood want to produce tokenized stocks for the crypto world. And so we are now seeing at least some of the spheres of influence butt up right against each other. Omar, when you saw this announcement from Robinhood just earlier this week, what were your first initial thoughts?
Omar Kanji:
[47:59] Yeah, I think, you know, Vlad's kind of teased the announcement over the last, I'd say, six, 12 months. And so you had a decent sense that it was coming. No one had any particularly great insight into what it was actually going to look like. But when it was announced, it made perfect sense. I'd say like, the important thing to understand or think about with respect to Robinhood, and it's slightly different relative to Coinbase, but Robinhood wants to be this place that allows our generation to trade everything. And so...
Omar Kanji:
[48:31] If you like think about it through that lens, like having an on-chain strategy is like critically important, right? Because like now you can have this liquid playground for a bunch of people to trade a range of different stocks, securities, non-securities,
Omar Kanji:
[48:48] Everything that you can kind of imagine under the sun. And like what better way for them to do that than have their own chain? And like in the traditional financial world, trades get routed to the range of traditional venues or liquidity providers. But here, this now allows them to be their own venue. And it's kind of an alternative take on what the world looks like. Whereas Robinhood was facilitating access to the traditional financial world, they're almost building the infrastructure for the new world. And I think it's important to understand when you think about the business as a whole, because if you look at their long-term arc and you go and you read and you listen to them speak about it, phase one of the business is be this active trader platform. Phase two is like the all-in-one neobank platform, which is like all of your financial services needs. And phase three is like the world's financial infrastructure. And so if you think about it through that lens, this is like a perfect piece to add into their product strategy, which allows them to offer like tokenized equities. It allows them to like use that as an infrastructure for the range of foreign markets that they're going to enter into over time. It allows them to offer a range of things like private stocks, again, which people can't trade, it'll allow them to do private real estate over time, like a whole bunch of different products. Now you have the flexibility to do in an environment which you control. As opposed to going and trying to back into the traditional financial system and working with the range of players. David, from the
David Hoffman:
[50:16] Coinbase side of things, what do you think was going through Coinbase's head when they saw this announcement? I'm sure that they thought that this was inevitable, but now they have a moat to defend, right? Base, pre-existing ecosystem, Robinhood, just Robinhood chain just an announcement. And so it already has a huge head start, but you can see Coinbase's biggest rival in this space start to appear. So what does coinbase need to do to defend its mo what do you think its next steps need to be yeah.
David Rodriguez:
[50:43] I mean i think that coinbase is still largely like the premier u.s based crypto exchange and like they're obviously trying to expand internationally obviously robinhood is starting largely with international you know largely eu markets for its crypto strategy which makes sense given the regulatory environment there i think that i think they're thinking like we have to be first mover advantage to all US-based crypto products in order to continue on if they're going to try to tackle Robinhood against the B2C vertical. They're launching US perps in, I think, July 21st, so two and a half, three weeks from now. Their hope, I'm guessing, is similar to what Robinhood did for options. They made options easy for our generation for high beta chasing risk on customers and like perps of the next evolution of, you know, pretty much options for crypto natives. And they're trying to introduce perps to the US capital markets, you know, the retail base for them. So I don't know if Rob, I don't know why Robinson hasn't announced US perps yet. Obviously, it's not a regulatory thing. Maybe it's because the acquisition of Deribit for Coinbase effectively allowed them to do this. And they're not effectively perpetual futures. They're actually There's long-dated options to have a five-year expiry, but who really holds perps for five years straight?
David Rodriguez:
[51:59] So I think Coinbase is thinking a few things. It's one, we have to grow US perps ASAP. That could be a material revenue driver for the business if they succeed. We already know how much Binance, for example, I think 90% of their entire trading volume is perps compared to Spot. And it's a large revenue driver for Binance and other offshore centralized exchanges.
David Rodriguez:
[52:22] I'm unsure how worried they are about Robinhood Chain. They should be worried. But if history repeats itself. Other centralized exchanges or with large distribution, large customer bases have not done that well launching their own L2 or their own L1. BNB may be the exception given they're the 900-pound gorilla in the room. They have a 100 million plus global US base. But if you look at every other centralized exchange so far, haven't done that well launching their own L2.
David Rodriguez:
[52:53] Bybit, I think they've reported they have a 60 million global user base. That is significantly larger than what robinette has has anyone used mantle i haven't they're now launching on solana with their own like you know decks has anyone used ink nothing against kraken i think they're a great exchange i am a customer of theirs as well but like i haven't used ink and now they're launching tokenized stocks on solana yeah world chain like i not the exact same thing but like world chain has also found a limited traction coinbase has a crypto first culture they have the brand and i think it's gonna be very hard to unseat coinbase as a l2 or as your own like execution environment but if any team is going to beat them it could be robinhood because of their operational excellence and their just their ability to execute but i i think obviously they're probably worried about their international expansion plans like robinhood going into the EU is obviously a risk for them.
David Rodriguez:
[53:56] Coinbase's international derivatives platform has grown a decent amount over the past six or so months. I think they recently hit over 10 billion OI. I could be mistaken there, but it has seen some really good growth over the past, I guess, the other date. I'm not personally familiar with how strong Robinhood's brand is in the EU. I think that'll be very interesting to see in the coming quarters on their earnings report, like how well is their international expansion plans growing.
David Rodriguez:
[54:24] Coinbase hasn't done exceptionally well on that front. And I don't know if that's an execution problem or the fact that like Binance and all these other offshore exchanges just have like such a moat and Binance themselves in their own right are trying to build their own super app. Right. And they have, again, a order of magnitude, maybe of more users than, than Robinhood does. And they have shown to their ability to execute over the past few years. If I'm Coinbase, the first thing I'm thinking about is make US perps the go-to venue for high beta chasing retail users. That should be the product that can potentially absorb or take users away from Robinhood. I'll stop for now and see what your guys' thoughts are.
David Hoffman:
[55:05] Omar, rebuttal, thoughts, arguments, what comes to mind?
Omar Kanji:
[55:09] No, I think like that is one of the Coinbase strengths, which is like it is a crypto first brand and a crypto native company. And because of that, they have like a range of different advantages that they can play in when Robinhood starts encroaching on their territory. I think, you know, if I was to articulate like the bull case for Robinhood is on the crypto side today anyways, I think like it's like a fee story largely, which is like Coinbase still charges like 1.4% roughly on retail trading volume. And HUD comes in at like 40 basis points. It's just like materially cheaper
Omar Kanji:
[55:44] to trade crypto on Robinhood. But at the same time, like I'm here in New York. And if I go to the Robinhood app and I try and buy crypto, there's like 22 tokens I can buy or roughly that number. Whereas if I go to Coinbase, I can buy 200 plus tokens. And I think like this crypto nativity and the willingness to take risk is like what really does allow Coinbase to build out its product offering, customer base, user base and like retain customers relative to, you know, a challenger that's entering into its space and trying to poach its customers on the retail side. And so like, I largely agree with everything David said, like, they do shouldn't lean into perps. It is a great product. Robynow doesn't offer them yet. I'm sure they will at some point.
Omar Kanji:
[56:31] Robynow is doing it out of Europe and like leverages capped at 3x. But it you know, it's still like a very nascent battleground, which Coinbase has a really, really good advantage in. And so they should just push on the gas if I were them.
David Rodriguez:
[56:47] Yeah, I think also a story for both companies, especially with Robinhood Launch and Robinhood Chain, is going to be what does that take rate look like over time? So Coinbase is obviously trying to, in a way, disintermediate its largest revenue driver, which is transaction revenue. I think its mixed take rate is approximately 30 bps between the retail and the institutional user. Obviously, retail gets absolutely fleeced, but it's the greatest business in the world.
David Rodriguez:
[57:13] But if you look at base, right, and they're obviously trying to, they're going to be enshrining, I guess, all the assets launched on base onto their front end on the Coinbase main app and eventually go after other assets on other ecosystems. The take rate, so if you look at like BASE's DEX volumes as a function of its sequencer revenue, it's an order magnitude less. So they have a 30 BIPs take rate on centralized exchange front end. BASE gets approximately a 3 BIPs take rate. And I think their thinking is we're going to move more on chain, the lower take rate, no other centralized exchange or no other traditional financial company can compete with us if we can offer a 3 BIPs take rate. But they're going to take maybe the Solana approach, which is low fees, high throughput equals more REV, more revenue, whatever you want to call it. And I'm curious to see what Robinhood's transaction revenue is going to be as more of its trading does move on chain. Is it going to be a similar take rate? Probably. Another thing that I think about when I think about Robinhood's business is you called out earlier, Omar, which is payment for order flow. The EU has banned payment for order flow as of the end of 2026. So what does that revenue model look like in the EU? And obviously, the US, it's still legal today. It will be legal tomorrow, probably. We have probably a more progressive regulatory environment in that sense.
David Rodriguez:
[58:37] But it will be interesting to see how well Robinhood does in international waters. Again, I don't know what the brand is internationally. I have a tough time believing that anyone that is using an offshore centralized exchange today will move to Robinhood. because Bybit, Binance, OKEx, you know, objectively offer great products for crypto users. But, you know, again, Robinhood is a behemoth and like really does have really strong execution and operational excellence. So maybe they can take users from those players.
Omar Kanji:
[59:08] Yeah, Mick, the only thing I'd add to this is like on the Robinhood side, if you like listen to Vlad talk about, you know, Robinhood chain, I think one of the things that he said recently is like he's going to focus on having an active developer ecosystem. And so that's Robinhood very much coming into Coinbase's territory. And obviously, Jesse's done a great job. And they have really built out that ecosystem. And so there are going to be challenges for Robinhood as they move on chain. And I know I'm the Robinhood bull here. I'm not trying to give too much of a fair case, but it will be a challenge for the business. And they have 10 different business lines that roughly do $100 million dollars plus each. And so they have a lot of shovels in the fire and lots of things that they are trying to do to build out that business across a range of vectors. And going to beat Coinbase on its own game is really, really hard. And so there are things to keep in mind and be careful of and just watch out for as Robinhood expands to this on-chain ecosystem. I'm sure a lot of people will build there, to be honest, just given the captive user base that Robinhood funnel but at the same time it's like if they have prided themselves on building great products and like they have to continue doing that and
David Rodriguez:
[1:00:18] I bet you robin hood's developers that launch on robin hood chain are going to be using coinbase developer platform to
Omar Kanji:
[1:00:23] Build their app yeah that's funny
David Hoffman:
[1:00:27] Guys, I've learned a lot so far in this conversation. So really, really glad you guys were able to come on and shed some of your knowledge. As we kind of wrap this up here, let's go back to the very beginning where I talked about the current valuations. Hood, the ticker is hood, $81 billion, coin $85 billion. So again, roughly neck and neck as it kind of stands today. Omar, when it comes to future hood aspirations, I know I can't ask you to ever predict the future of the market. it. You know, we have macro that we have to can be concerned about, but obviously your bullish hood, like what kind of numbers are you looking for? Are you looking for, you know, a 50% gain? Are you looking for a 500% gain? What kind of timelines are you thinking about? Just shed some light about your future, your future imaginations for where this could go.
Omar Kanji:
[1:01:10] Yeah, I haven't sold any hood and I've sold it for a while. And I think that one, the one aspect of this story that we like didn't talk about, which is like really important to think about when you look at hood's valuation is there is like our parents generation and our grandparents that unfortunately aren't going to be with us forever. And like the way Robin hood is building their business is to very much be the primary recipient of like this generational wealth transfer. And if you like, look at a range of different forecasts, like the numbers look something like 10 trillion dollars over the next decade plus. And so like,
Omar Kanji:
[1:01:46] If you were to just like truly think about what happens in that bear scenario where someone that you love or in your family passes away, where does that money flow? Does it end up sitting on like the traditional platforms that your parents are using? Does it end up coming to what you're using?
Omar Kanji:
[1:02:02] And I think like, I have a quite constructive view on that, which is, I think Robinhood is going to be one of the primary beneficiaries, especially if I do my banking, my payments, and all my investing. And if that number is anywhere in that wheelhouse, and they're able to capture, you know, 10% of that, which is like a trillion dollars, which is insane, you know, so 1%, you know, you are talking about a business that can more than double, triple, or quadruple, without like having to go too far out on the imagination spectrum. And so it's part of the reason why they bought a company called Trade PMR, which is, if I have money passed down, I want to do it in the most tax efficient and optimized way. And so that when that money does come, I have access to the right financial advisors. I have access to the right tax professionals. And I have right access to like the range of different investment alternatives to make sure my family's set up. And then when you think about it in the construct of their whole business, which is like, if I have a Robinhood gold card, and I have virtual cards for my kids, and like my wife is on it, and everything is encapsulated, Robinhood will be one of the primary beneficiaries of all of that in the future. And so I think when you look at $80 billion, it is expensive. There's no doubt about it. The stock, to your point, it's run up a lot recently. But I do think if the business is the primary beneficiary of this wealth transfer, and you don't really even need to believe anything else. You can almost discount the crypto stuff.
Omar Kanji:
[1:03:28] It's a business that should be worth a few hundred billion dollars over the coming decade. And I think it's probably underselling it relative to the opportunities set globally and the financial infrastructure globally, and the range of different ways they can monetize. Today, it's $150 million or $150 ARPU per user. And so I think they're... Yeah, I'm not going to put on a specific price target on it, but I do think it's expensive relative to the business today, but it's not relative and not expensive relative to what it can potentially grow into. And so for that reason, I continue to be bullish. And I am a big fan of Vlad and everything he has done. And I feel like it sits at the perfect intersection of changing technology, just global societal trends with populations, and the way we interact with technology. And so I love it for all of those reasons. They've done a great job. And so I think even if the valuation does seem expensive today, if you look at it on a reasonable time horizon, they can more than grow into that and exceed it by a large margin.
David Hoffman:
[1:04:31] I definitely really enjoy that thesis because this is also one of the same theses that make me bullish about crypto. This is something that the crypto industry has chanted. It's like when that wealth does come down from the boomers and the Gen Xs down into the millennials and Zoomers, those generations are going to buy assets that they relate to, which is Bitcoin and crypto assets, Ether. And so I've heard that same thesis, Omar, but I've also heard it in the crypto context, too, which definitely benefits Coinbase in a similar fashion. Maybe Robinhood has a bigger net, and I could totally take that argument. But nonetheless, I think that's generally bullish for crypto assets, which I'm going to take that same argument and give it a plus one to the Coinbase side as well. David, I want to throw the same kind of question to you. Again, $85 billion Coinbase is where it currently sits. Again, I don't want to pin you down to any sort of timeframes, but give me a similar kind of ending thesis to Coinbase and its future aspirations.
David Rodriguez:
[1:05:27] Yeah, I mean, I said something to Omar, I would say, yesterday or the day before. I think the target for both these companies is higher on a longer timeframe. The near term target is Bank of America, $300 billion plus market cap. The long term target is overtaking JP Morgan, $800 billion plus. I think both of them can do that in a decade, potentially by the end of this decade, depending on how large the shift is in terms of global wealth transfer
David Rodriguez:
[1:05:51] from demographics and also a technology shift from off chain to on chain. So I think Robinhood is the demographic wealth transfer play. I think Coinbase is the technology shift play to the global on-chain economy. Sorry, the global economy moving on-chain. Coinbase is the preeminent...
David Rodriguez:
[1:06:12] U.S.-based crypto company, the largest capital market in the entire world, $100 trillion plus on global economy. If you believe that the capital markets will move on chain, I think Coinbase is the clear play. It has $930 million of adjusted EBITDA in Q1 alone, compared to Robinhood sitting at about $430 to $450 million adjusted EBITDA. Yes, Robinhood does have a higher ARPU. I think it's like 30% to 40% higher, even though it's largely an estimate on Coinbase because they don't share their monthly transacting users anymore like they used to.
David Rodriguez:
[1:06:46] Robinhood does have a larger net today. But I think if you look at the overall growth rate of Coinbase year over year, even quarter over quarter, over year over year basis, it's growing about 25%. Obviously, maybe a little harder to discern because of the cyclicality nature of the crypto industry. But if you look at its subscription and services revenue, it's growing at about 35% to 36% year over year. Very much like what Omar said, I think both companies are expensive today. But I think that if you look at both businesses, they have a very clear line of sight to 10xing their revenue over the foreseeable future. I think Coinbase's revenue growth is largely going to come from maybe in the short to midterm, maybe it comes from US perps, if it is a hit, in addition to the growth of stable coins on chain and obviously getting the large revenue share from Circle. I think the long-term thesis on Coinbase is that it is a thin layer. It is a thin infrastructure layer for the economy moving on chain. And it's going to power every single front end, TradFi or fintech front end in the world, maybe outside of Robinhood. But every single developer that is building in the on-chain economy is going to be using some tool set that is developed through Coinbase. And they're going to figure out a really intricate or really elegant way to monetize that and have a high-margin, high-growth business for years to come.
David Rodriguez:
[1:08:10] Yeah, so very bullish both. I think Coinbase is just a bet on the industry growing.
David Rodriguez:
[1:08:18] Robinhood is a bet on Robinhood. And I think both will do extremely well.
David Hoffman:
[1:08:22] Well, I mean, I went into this episode thinking like it's going to be coin versus hood. But I think it's as we wrap this up, it's going to be coin and hood. I don't really see why they actually need to be there. They are doing very similar things, but in pretty different lanes that definitely do touch in certain arenas. But overall, I think it's just a story of two new companies bringing the world of finance into modernity in their own particular ways, in ways that are very necessary and meaningfully differentiated. And so this was a great discussion, guys. And I think my big takeaway is going to be Coin and Hood in the future.
Omar Kanji:
[1:08:59] Awesome. Thank you for having us. It was great.
David Hoffman:
[1:09:03] Great talk. Omar, we will get your Twitter into the show notes. You are from dragonfly and david we will also get your twitter from in from from twitter into the show notes as well you are from blockworks guys i learned a lot you guys were this is a phenomenal episode really appreciate you guys coming on and sharing your knowledge.
Omar Kanji:
[1:09:18] Thank you very much thank you again
David Hoffman:
[1:09:19] Bankless nation you guys know the deal crypto is risky equities they're risky too but you know what being sidelined also risky so you can lose what you put in but nonetheless we are headed west this frontier it's not for everyone but you're glad you are with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot.

3. Robinhood Announces Tokenized Stocks!
📖 Summary: https://youtu.be/Ovp3N-102LQ
David Hoffman:
[0:03] I'm here with vlad ceo of robinhood right at the end of their uh to catch a token summit vlad you guys launched so many things today as this
David Hoffman:
[0:13] wraps up share a little bit of your sentiment how are you feeling.
Vlad Tenev:
[0:15] I'm feeling really good i mean i think that there was one technical glitch which you probably noticed oh the
David Hoffman:
[0:22] Slow connectivity i thought that was easily overcomable.
Vlad Tenev:
[0:25] Yeah yeah so what turned out what happened was so many people were downloading the app and trying to get the stock tokens that it brought down the network so yeah but it turned out everything worked i thought the team did a nice job and it was a lot of fun you know we put so much work into these products the engineers are building them they've been working for a long time that i think the least we can do is put put on a nice event so that we can communicate the value as nicely as possible so i think it was a lot of fun it was hopefully the the crowd enjoyed it too you
David Hoffman:
[0:56] Guys did a great job. Now, I had the embargo. You guys gave us the embargo. So I knew it was coming. Yeah. Except for the private tokenized companies of SpaceX and OpenAI,
David Hoffman:
[1:06] which I think kind of stole the show for what everyone was excited about. And that's really something that is something that Robinhood is really tapping into what feels like just the financials like ice of our times. You know, with so much VC capital out there, companies are able to stay private later and later. This is something that we talked about last time you were on the show. Was this something that because after you built out the tokenized stocks product offering, you were like, oh, we could easily just extend this to private companies? Or what was the thought process behind that?
Vlad Tenev:
[1:35] Yeah. So the thought process was twofold. I don't know if you've caught the op-ed that I wrote in the Washington Post earlier this year. And really, I've been thinking about tokenization for many, many years. And the benefits of tokenization is very, very clear that it's the future.
Vlad Tenev:
[1:53] And it's very useful for Europeans and folks outside the U.S. And then when you communicate the value of the technology inside the U.S., it's sort of like talking about high speed rail when you already have medium speed rail. And by that, I mean, in the U.S., we already have pretty robust financial infrastructure. It's not amazing, but we don't have 24-7, We have 24.5 trading of stocks. It's pretty good. It's pretty easy to use. Robinhood, I think, has played a role in democratizing it and making it accessible to tens of millions of customers. So the delta between tokenization and the existing infrastructure for public stocks is there.
Vlad Tenev:
[2:36] I think it will happen, but it's perhaps a little bit less severe than outside the US. But one benefit that I think is very, very strong is the ability to to make all kinds of assets tradable, even those that aren't on liquid exchanges. And private stocks are this thing that you know, it's frankly a big problem. You have companies like SpaceX and OpenAI that are worth hundreds of billions. They're essentially able to raise unlimited amounts of capital while staying private. And if you're a retail investor, you're shut out from all of that appreciation. Even a high net worth investor has difficulty getting into some of these companies.
David Hoffman:
[3:16] And interestingly enough, they're also the coolest companies that everyone wants access to.
Vlad Tenev:
[3:20] Yeah, it's actually, it concerns me quite a bit that AI, I believe, is going to be an incredibly transformative platform shift, probably bigger than we've had before, bigger than mobile, maybe even bigger
Vlad Tenev:
[3:33] than the internet on relative terms. And yet it's not like the internet where you had the dot coms and you could have exposure to all of these assets in the private markets. By and large, a lot of the innovation is in private companies that shut out retail. So if we can democratize it, make it available, you know, outside the U.S. Where there's clarity, but over time, bring this technology, which truly will allow 24-7 real-time trading of private companies to the U.S. as well. I think that could, I mean, I think that could resolve one of the greatest longstanding inequities in capital markets today.
David Hoffman:
[4:10] So I'm imagining this rollout to Robinhood Retail. There can only be so many shares of OpenAI and SpaceX on the market. It is a private company. There are shares that do float, that do trade, but there can't be that many. I could imagine the hype behind this growing quite large. And then all of a sudden there being a supply shortage of OpenAI or SpaceX shares
David Hoffman:
[4:33] to create a pretty premium, a premium on the shares. Do you have enough of those shares to actually supply to the market that has the demand for them?
Vlad Tenev:
[4:41] Well, this is just the beginning. And as I mentioned on the presentation, the OpenAI and the SpaceX shares right now are a gift to these users. So we had, I wanna say a million open AI, half a million of SpaceX. So you're right. The focus now is on making sure we can get them tradable 24 seven. I think that'll be a big technology unlock and we believe we have a path to do that. And then over the long run, we're gonna open this up much bigger. So I think you should be able to, on a secondary basis, transact a huge number of private companies, a large number of private companies, thousands. And then I think this could actually grow to a primary source of capital as well. So if you think about, you know, OpenAI, SpaceX, companies of that nature, they have raised tens of billions in funding, maybe hundreds of billions. And so if retail can become a mechanism and a vector, not just for secondary transactions, but for entrepreneurs when they want to raise primary capital, even at early stages. I think that's super transformative for entrepreneurship. And people don't talk about that enough. I think that could lead to more startups and more entrepreneurship in the world by a very, very wide margin.
David Hoffman:
[5:57] Yeah, certainly. There's something that the NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange should really be taking a look at, which is that there's a possibility that OpenAI, SpaceX, say this tokenization vertical out of Robinhood really gets a lot of traction, the traction that I'm sure you wanted to. If there is dominant liquidity for these assets that happen on chain and inside of crypto venues, and the companies can also raise money from retail investors or just from the private market world, even though it's trading publicly, there's perhaps just never a need for these private companies to actually do the traditional IPO and go on the public traditional markets, but they can go on the public blockchain markets. Is that a world that you're trying to foster?
Vlad Tenev:
[6:37] Well, I think a lot of people ask about, alternatives to the traditional IPO process, I think we've already seen an alternative to the traditional IPO process, which is companies just staying private essentially forever. I mean, these companies have an alternative. They could just keep raising unlimited amounts of capital in the private markets and in doing so shut out retail potentially forever. I mean, you've had some founders say that They never plan to go public.
David Hoffman:
[7:11] It's a burden. Yeah.
Vlad Tenev:
[7:12] So I think the solution for that case is, I mean, I'm generally pro the IPO as a process. Of course, it's gotten very burdensome, but Robinhood became a public company in 2021.
Vlad Tenev:
[7:26] I think some people in the environment will just choose to not go public. And for that, we need to figure out how to unlock the private shares and make them available to retail as well.
David Hoffman:
[7:38] Certainly. Now, there's a notion that capital begets capital, liquidity begets liquidity. And again, if these private companies start trading on crypto venues, you can see the dominant price discovery of these assets, the liquidity of these assets happen on chain or on Bitstamp for when it's weekends and amongst those other things. And one of the big features of this is the 24-7, 365 markets that tokenization really enables for you. There have been some promises that the crypto industry, checks that we wrote as an industry back in 2011, 2013, everything is going to come on chain. We're going to tokenize the world. 24-7, 365 trading, include retail earlier and earlier in the process. And just there's a couple announcements here. The tokenized stocks, tokenized private companies, and 24-7, 365 trading of traditional assets all happening in this announcement. And so I'm getting this idea that, well, there's a few instances of Robinhood actually cashing that check that the crypto industry conceptually wrote in 2013.
David Hoffman:
[8:38] So it gets me excited. There's no real question here. Yeah. But there's a full circle coming here at this event.
Vlad Tenev:
[8:45] Yeah, I think that it's really interesting. Yeah. There has been a lot of talk and legitimately not a ton of action in the form of usable products that are compliant in like real jurisdictions. And I think the problem, the reason it's taken this long is you need to be incredibly strong at two things that are very, very different. One is there needs to be a certain amount of like regulatory know-how, working with regulators, trad fi muscle, I'll call it, that we've kind of refined over 10 plus years of being regulated very, very heavily across multiple jurisdictions. We also have to understand these assets and these traditional assets that we have to tokenize. And we've built up a very, very scaled traditional financial services business while simultaneously becoming one of the largest players in retail crypto in the U.S., but now expanding outside. And so I don't think too many companies can bridge that gap of being very, very strong in TradFi and crypto. And I think that's what's needed to merge the two. And also just being sort of like more muscular from a regulatory standpoint where, you know, we've worked hard over the past 10 years. And a lot of the policymakers and regulators that have helped make this happen are actually at this event tonight.
David Hoffman:
[10:10] Right. Certainly. Yeah. So one of the announcements that you guys had is perps, futures, perps for crypto assets.
David Hoffman:
[10:16] But once you have a tokenized stock, that also becomes a crypto asset. So down the line, is there on the roadmap, perps, perp futures, as you announced for crypto, but for tokenized stocks?
Vlad Tenev:
[10:27] That's a good question. I think the intent is the technology that we've built here is incredibly general. It can be used to power and tokenize pretty much anything. And actually...
David Hoffman:
[10:42] Private stocks and public stocks are quite different mechanically as assets.
Vlad Tenev:
[10:48] So, you know, we'll take customer demand. We'll probably have futures versions of crypto assets. I mean, we've listed a bunch of those in the U.S. Already with, you know, the micro XRP and ETH and Solana futures, which are sort of like TradFi instruments of crypto products. And then with tokenization, It's crypto instruments that reflect TradFi products. And we'll just offer everything the customers want in a safe and compliant manner. That's the goal.
David Hoffman:
[11:23] The crypto idea is that perps are better than options. And so the crypto believer will say like, oh, well, if it's a head to head competition between perps and options, people are going to use perps every single time. It's more intuitive. It's more easy to think about. And so I would hope that as perps becomes more understood by the audience, the consumer base, that perps as a financial instrument would proliferate, you know, alongside the rise of tokenized equities, tokenized stocks. That's my that's my attitude. I don't know if you have a comment on that or just or anything at all.
Vlad Tenev:
[11:53] You know, I don't want to upset my options friends. I think they have their unique use cases. I mean, there are certain scenarios where an options trade might make sense. And, you know, you could put together a multi-leg strategy and benefit from sideways markets perhaps a little bit more easily than you could with a straight up perpetual future. You could have, you know, iron condors or butterflies.
Vlad Tenev:
[12:21] These are things that our active traders are really experts in many cases. So if there's a demand for those products, we have the capability of adding them as well.
David Hoffman:
[12:31] And with the access for the United States markets, which I'm sure plenty of United States viewers watching this and also watching the announcement, I'm sure just chomping at the bit to get their hands on perps on the side of Robinhood or tokenized stocks on the side of Robinhood. I know you guys are barred by the CFTC. You guys need the CFTC to give yourselves a thumbs up. Coinbase, I'm sure, is also waiting for that same regulatory green light to launch these tokenized stocks for their retail base. Are you in conversations with the CFTC? Are we at the beginning of this conversation?
David Hoffman:
[12:59] Kind of where are we for U.S. citizens getting their hands on these things?
Vlad Tenev:
[13:02] Yeah, I mean, it's our belief that tokenized stocks in the U.S. Will end up being governed by the SEC, regulated by the SEC.
David Hoffman:
[13:11] I mean, that was the perpetuals conversation. Pardon me.
Vlad Tenev:
[13:13] Yeah, the perpetuals would be governed by the CFTC. And when it comes to stocks, I think there's openness from the SEC, the Crypto Task Force, who we have been having meetings with. You know, Johan, our crypto GM, was in Washington a couple of weeks ago on the tokenization roundtable, which was hosted by the Crypto Task Force. And yeah, it's our belief, actually, that this can be done by the SEC alone without the need for additional rulemaking by Congress. And they seem open to it. But I think in the US in particular, we want to make sure any product we roll out is fully compliant and the regulators are on board every step along the way. In particular, because our offerings in the US are so good already. We've got 24-5 trading, a huge universe of stocks. It's very easy to use with Robinhood.
Vlad Tenev:
[14:11] So you would get weekends and holidays, which are nice. but we want to make sure that very, very good and an amazingly compliant product. And we think we can get there. We have the technology. We think we can get there relatively soon.
David Hoffman:
[14:27] Certainly. So Robinhood has become a leading crypto platform for its retail user base, largely because you guys have so much distribution. Your crypto products previously have lagged other competitors, whereas like Coinbase has more assets on their platform. They had their wallet before Robinhood had the wallet. And so when Robinhood would release a product, it would generally be somewhere between 6 to 12 months behind a Coinbase product because Coinbase is crypto-specific, it's crypto-native. Robinhood, you have plenty of TradFi activity that you also need to maintain. But on this, with the announcements here today, some of them are products that Coinbase just announced just a few weeks ago. And with many of the on-chain stocks, that's actually leapfrogging Coinbase. They kind of beat them to a punch on a number of the things. So is this Robinhood becoming a leading crypto-native company? I know 30% of your revenue already comes from crypto. And so where do you think your relationship with crypto grows? Are you investing even further into this industry? Are you guys trying to go and take down Coinbase? What do you think?
Vlad Tenev:
[15:24] Yeah, it's an interesting question. I'd say traditionally, you're right. Our approach to building products and rolling out features has sometimes been described as Apple-like in the sense that Apple really uses it. It's usually not the first to market, not like the bleeding edge innovator, but they sort of like focus on the user experience and the design and the product quality and make it very, very accessible. And I think that's been a good analogy. I mean, we, I think when you bring up the wallet as an example, like our wallet wasn't the first to market, but I think it was the first to market.
Vlad Tenev:
[16:03] In an intuitive way that rolled out features like gasless swapping, which I think if you're a retail user and you expect this technology to go mass market, like thinking through the gas and the fees and a different currency is just very, very confusing. So we felt like gasless swapping was important. And I think we were actually one of the first to enable that. But you're also right that, you know, now we're kind of pushing the frontier. And I think we are the first big platform or at least among the first to roll out these tokenized offerings and with the private company stock tokens definitely on the bleeding edge so it's a new place for us to to be in we're we're usually used to you know coming in later into a market taking share through just like price competition efficiency sort of a war of attrition and and now being first but bringing that capability of lower pricing great technology it's it's fun so we'll see how it goes last question,
David Hoffman:
[17:01] Vlad, and I know you have to hop to another interview. The layer two, the Robinhood chain.
David Hoffman:
[17:05] Yeah.
David Hoffman:
[17:06] Talk to me about what the long-term relationship is between the Robinhood app and the Robinhood chain. And I think listeners and myself, our frames of knowledge are going to come from the relationship between Coinbase and BASE, where BASE is actually a pretty big universe in of itself. And then Coinbase also uses BASE to get Bitcoin back to loans, and they offer that straight through the front end. Is this kind of something that you're trying to do similarly with Robinhood, where you have, it's a developer ecosystem, developers can build permissionlessly on the Robinhood chain, or are you more using it just to settle backend logic for your own needs and your own simplicity?
David Hoffman:
[17:39] How do you think about the long-term relationship between Robinhood and its own layer too?
Vlad Tenev:
[17:43] Yeah, and by the way, I think the team over at Base, it's a good team. I think they've done a very, very nice job and they're pushing the sort of like Base is for everyone campaign, which I think has been relatively effective. I think our niche in this space is it's maybe not going to be useful for everyone in every use case. But what we intend to do is make it the best chain for real world assets. I think real world assets have very specific needs and qualities and making this the best chain for real world assets, starting with stocks, going into private company shares, We mentioned real estate and art, and those things are very, very interesting to me as well. And combining that with the lowest possible fees, and really, I like to call it, we're trying to build military-grade robustness. I think that's going to be exciting. And I do think that that's going to be an interesting proposition that should attract some developers. We talked to a lot of folks building chains and the value prop that i hear a lot of is you know this is the number one chain for dgens sure yeah i probably i probably met like seven or eight dgen chain builders um and we're trying to go in the opposite direction we wanted to be the number one chain for real world assets and for it to sort of confer fundamental utility to to all participants cool
David Hoffman:
[19:09] Well vlad i can say i'm i'm excited for what you guys have announced i'm and pretty optimistic for what you guys can do. And it's nice to see another big company helping the world move on change. So we appreciate it.
Vlad Tenev:
[19:18] Thank you. Yeah, thank you for joining us here and helping be part of the journey.
David Hoffman:
[19:23] I do have to ask, last time we had you on the show, we talked about tokenization
David Hoffman:
[19:27] of X3Ds and you talked about the private markets and all that. And I wrote this article on Banklist the next day saying Vlad wants to tokenize SpaceX and OpenAI. Yes. So these plans have been in the works for a while or when did that idea come about?
Vlad Tenev:
[19:42] Let's see. Well, I talked about SpaceX and OpenAI in the op-ed. And what I found is if you write about stuff often enough, sometimes it ends up happening.
David Hoffman:
[19:55] You manifested it.
Vlad Tenev:
[19:56] Yeah, I'd like to think so. And of course, it's really nice to see that a lot of competitors have been jumping on and trying to do this stuff too, which I think would be good. I think I'm here for the future when everything is on chain And we move beyond Bitcoin and meme coins into a place where crypto is actually very, very useful and it confers fundamental utility to participants. And I think that's going to be exciting. And the time has come. I think it's this year.
David Hoffman:
[20:25] Vlad, congrats and thanks for coming on the show.
Vlad Tenev:
[20:27] Thank you so much.
David Hoffman:
[20:28] Cheers.
David Hoffman:
[22:25] I'm here with Johan,
David Hoffman:
[22:26] The GM of crypto at Robinhood. Johan, people are familiar with Vlad,
David Hoffman:
[22:30] the CEO. I think people are a little bit less familiar with Johan. Tell us a little bit about yourself. What's your role in the whole Robinhood universe?
David Hoffman:
[22:38] Yeah, so I lead the crypto business at Robinhood. So everything that is related to crypto usually goes around my team. And, you know, we are really excited to have launched all these products today. I initially joined Robinhood a bit more than four years ago as a CTO for the crypto group.
Johann Kerbrat:
[22:50] And I've been running the business for a few years now.
David Hoffman:
[22:53] And so all of the big decisions that happen in the crypto universe of Robinhood, the Bitstamp acquisition, the Robinhood wallet, all of this is under your oversight.
Johann Kerbrat:
[23:03] Yes, I would be right. So my team and I, you know, we work very hard on all this announcement and this project and this acquisition. And so we are really excited to see, you know, the enthusiasm from people here.
David Hoffman:
[23:14] So the acquisition of Bitstamp was a pretty big deal. Before that, there was the Robinhood wallet. Before that, there was just, you know, you could buy select crypto assets on Robinhood.
David Hoffman:
[23:23] There's been certainly a crescendoing of activity on the crypto side of things from Robinhood. Just talk a little bit about Robinhood's long arc with crypto. It seems to be growing. It seems to be like crescendoing and excitement. Talk about that arc and where we are today. Yeah.
Johann Kerbrat:
[23:38] So, you know, we launched crypto in 2018, to your point, with just a few assets. And then we started to add more assets. We started to add functionality, like transferring the Robinhood wallet, which was our self-custody wallet. And slowly we, you know, really build on this vision that crypto and blockchain technology can be the backbone of the financial system of tomorrow. And really what this event is about is how will we rebuild Robynode using blockchain technology. And, you know, in the EU, we're actually almost all in blockchain technology. So now EU customers can actually trade crypto, stake crypto, but they can also do perpetual on two assets. And they can also do stock tokens to get exposure to U.S. stocks. and ETF and so
David Hoffman:
[24:19] I think that's what's really exciting for me.
Johann Kerbrat:
[24:21] You know, I joined Robinhood because I wanted to bring this mass adoption and stop talking just about the technical and the protocols and actually giving
Johann Kerbrat:
[24:28] tools that people can use every day and use blockchain.
David Hoffman:
[24:31] So Perps is one of the big announcements that you guys had today. And Perps is a financial instrument that was created in the crypto universe, but isn't inherently crypto by any means. It's just a neutral financial instrument, in theory, that could have gone into the regular Robinhood app for regular tokenized or non-tokenized assets, normal equities. But instead, it is first being primarily introduced in the crypto context, of which it's native. So that's under your domain. Talk about that choice to keep it inside of the crypto context when it could have also been applied to more normal financial instruments in the rest of Robinhood.
Johann Kerbrat:
[25:03] Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, there is a few issues on, you know, the CFTC side. And for example, perhaps are not necessarily something that exists in the U.S. today. We can do like long dated contracts, but it's not something that really is a perpetual that roll over indefinitely. And so in the EU, we received our license, our MIFID license and our MICA license. So we're able to actually bring perpetuals. And it's something that is really exciting because, you know, a lot of what we are saying on stage was about how complicated it is to use perps on different platforms. And you can very hardly do it on a phone. You know, you always have to update, you'll take profit, you'll stop loss. You want to make sure that, you know, you're not going to lose too much money or take too much risk. And so you're always having to kind of stay at a desktop to use it. And so what we wanted to build on Robinhood was really an interface that you can use on an on-to-go basis, basically. And just with a swipe of a finger, being able to update your position and your strategy and make sure that you don't take too many risks.
David Hoffman:
[26:02] Do you see the Perps instrument spreading further and more integrated into the rest of Robinhood? Or is it kind of you'll follow the demand? We'll see how it is adopted. How do you see it expanding?
Johann Kerbrat:
[26:14] Yeah, I think, you know, there is two aspects for the Perps. There is the retail. There is also the institutional aspect. So the backend that we're using for Perps is Bitstamp. And that exchange is actually open to institutions. So we expect to see institutions also coming to that. But we also announced stock tokens today that are like
Johann Kerbrat:
[26:30] token that gives you exposure to US stocks, US ETF. In a world where you have crypto tokens and perps combined together, you could see a world where you can, you know, have perps on tokenized asset,
David Hoffman:
[26:43] Basically. Let's talk about the chain, because I think that's one of the most exciting announcements that we've seen out of today. But there was also a choice that was made. I'm fuzzy on the details, but I understand that there was also a potential deal, some sort of deal with Solana about some interest in working with Solana. Maybe that deal is still open. I don't know. But what we heard from today out
David Hoffman:
[27:04] of Robinhood was the launch of a Layer 2 on the Arbitrum Orbit tech stack. So talk to us about that choice, that strategy. Why was that the right strategy for Robinhood?
Johann Kerbrat:
[27:12] Well, you know, there was a few things. We talked to a lot of chains. So, you know, when the rumor started, it was just about the fact that we were talking to chains. And for us, we wanted to understand, like, do we want to use an existing permissionless chain or do we want to build something that is custom for us? And really, when we started to look at the complexity of what we were trying to build and all the ambition that we have around stock tokens and bringing the financial system on chain, we felt like having our chain was giving us a lot more optionality. We are able to build the right regulatory requirements on the chain and also making sure that, you know, it can scale with us.
David Hoffman:
[27:47] And why Arbitrum, you know,
Johann Kerbrat:
[27:49] For us, there was a few things. We really liked the fact that the way that you can use stylus, which is a system that basically allows you to use any kind of code. So you don't have to be stuck with one as a type of code, but you can actually bring like Rust, C++, whatever you want. And so that's very helpful if you're thinking about the long term and the type of products that we want to build. The second thing that we liked was the priority queue system that is non-predatory. And also, you know, we have been a good partner with Arbitrum for a long time. We've partnered a few times on the wallet. And we overall expect to be a good partner with every chain. So you mentioned Solana. We offer, for example, no fees on the wallet on Solana if you're a gold customer. We also offer staking on Solana on multiple platforms. So we want to be good partners with everybody.
David Hoffman:
[28:34] Okay, so just to trace over what I heard you say, the main reason why the Arbitrum Layer 2 was selected was, one, the customizability, and also, two, the reading between the lines, the MEV control, as in if you guys run the sequencer, you know, MEV is a very legally dubious topic. And if you outsource that to external parties, then all of a sudden there's a little bit outside of your control. So if you have a single sequencer, which I would imagine Robinhood is going to run, you guys just can make sure that there is no things like front running, back running, things that would otherwise be illegal in a traditional context because you guys are operating the chain. So customizability and control, is that kind of the two key features here?
Johann Kerbrat:
[29:10] Yeah, some of the features. You know, there was also the interoperability between multiple ecosystems, Ethereum being a big one. You know, there's many on EVM. So we were really excited about that. But yeah, I think you're right. I think the idea of having just one sequencer is not necessarily true. Like, you know, I think at some point we'll want to bring a decentralization. And I think using the Arbitrum stack is helpful for that. But, you know, I think you're right. We want to make sure that we can control the products that we are going to launch at the beginning, but also build tools that are kind of the platform for everyone else to build on top of it and use the technology that we are creating today.
David Hoffman:
[29:48] Let's lean into that interoperability word. If you say that you are interested in interoperability right after you talk about an announcement of tokenized stocks, I get images of these tokenized stocks moving beyond Robinhood chain. Is that an explicit part of the plan? Talk about that future. Yeah, absolutely.
Johann Kerbrat:
[30:04] You know, I think for us, the idea of tokenized asset has been that we are removing them from the wall garden. And so you can transfer them between broker. You can do a lot more things with it. Maybe, you know, you can use all the things that you're thinking about DeFi and assets. And so for us, we know that, you know, people want to move to a different chain or they want to move to a different platform. And I think it's part of the DNA.
David Hoffman:
[30:27] If we want that product to be really successful,
Johann Kerbrat:
[30:29] We don't want to recreate another traditional finance system. So definitely.
David Hoffman:
[30:33] So are the stock tokens, are they whitelisted? Or what are the transferability conditions that are built into the token contract of the Robinhood stock tokens?
Johann Kerbrat:
[30:42] Yeah, so right now what we announced today for the launch, we are going to just allow it within the Robinhood app. And we are going to open self-custody pretty soon. You saw it during the demo. We tried to transfer from our self-custody wallet to the Robinhood app. And so we are kind of ready to go. We just want to make sure that, you know, the product is working well before we open the gate. Okay.
David Hoffman:
[31:04] So are there, is there a whitelist contract as in if I say, say I'm a, I have a Robinhood account or, or excuse me, an Arbitrum wallet and I send my equity tokens to my wallet. Can I send it to a friend who has another Arbitrum wallet or would they have to also be a part of the Robinhood KYC universe?
Johann Kerbrat:
[31:23] Yeah, in the future, we would want everyone to be able to transfer between each other. I think where, you know, the mint and burning will be where you will need to be either a Robinhood customer or you will have to be a customer of somebody that is compatible with Allstack.
David Hoffman:
[31:36] Okay, cool. It makes sense that you guys have chosen Arbitrum. I was talking to AJ about this because Arbitrum is so inherently DeFi focused. So, you know, it's one thing to be able to buy and hold tokenized equities, you know, private companies especially. But it's another thing to be able to compose those into a broader DeFi ecosystem, which Arbitrum definitely has. And so are you envisioning a world where there's an Aave implementation on the Arbitrum layer two? Or there's a Uniswap. So can you see these tokens being interoperable with the existing DeFi Arbitrum ecosystem?
Johann Kerbrat:
[32:10] I mean, that's a goal. I think we want in the future to be able to do all of this. I think it's going to be hard for me to tell you, is it going to be a Aave? It's going to be a morpho or something else. But we want to make it compatible, and that's why we picked kind of an EVM-based solution for our layer. Otherwise, you know, we could have done our own layer one or we could have kept it on a non-permissionless chain. It would have been a lot faster and easier.
David Hoffman:
[32:35] But there's also nothing inherently stopping you guys from issuing these tokens on Solana in the future, right? If there's demand there, could you also see yourselves tokenize these across many chains?
Johann Kerbrat:
[32:44] I think bridging is going to be part of the strategy. overall, you know, like I think, again, we want everyone to be able to use it. And so for that, I think you need to be able to give access to everybody and
Johann Kerbrat:
[32:54] you won't be able to do that if you limit yourself to just one chain.
David Hoffman:
[32:58] So when I was listening to Vlad talk about with the whiteboard session, he talked about all the different components of the Robinhood world, especially as it came to issuing these tokens and then also having them trade on Bitstamp when, you know, the very constrained traditional markets are only alive, you know, so many hours of the week. But now Bitstamp can trade them 24-7. And then you also have the Robinhood wallet as well. There's a very tightly integrated ecosystem of components that are being woven together there. Was that your mastermind? Is that your strategy?
Johann Kerbrat:
[33:29] Well, I don't know about that. I think, you know, we have a very big team with a lot of talented people. But I think for us, that was kind of the idea. The exchange when we acquired Bitstamp was this idea of not being only reliant on market maker, but being able to support some of the new products we are thinking of, like tokenized assets. And the Robin wallet is also something that, you know, four years ago when we were starting to build it, the idea was really to think about the DeFi world and think about the fact that at some point people may not want to use centralized platform. And so it's great to see everything going together and, you know, we hope to keep going like this and there is a lot more plans that we have shared also on the private stock, for example, that is going to really get together nicely in this ecosystem.
David Hoffman:
[34:12] Spawning a brand new chain is a pretty big undertaking. It's one thing to use your own chain to deploy your own assets and to do the backend things that Robinhood needs to do, which I think we're all very happy about.
David Hoffman:
[34:24] That's what blockchains are for. That's one of the big bull cases. But there's also the conversation of, well, the Robinhood chain is also going to be permissionless as well for developers and users. So that means that any old developer can come and do things on Robinhood chain. Is that a specific vertical that you are trying to foster?
Johann Kerbrat:
[34:40] Yeah, we are excited about that. I think we call all the developers that want to be working on the WhoChain that want to talk to Robin Hood about this like it's something that we want to do and we think that will happen for us it's So the big long-term vision is that everybody can use the stock tokens, everybody can build on it, and you can see more type of real-world assets. And so for that, we will need a lot of developers because as important Robinhood is and with a great team that we have, we can build the entire DeFi world. There's so many things being innovating every day. And so we think that it's all coming together.
David Hoffman:
[35:15] So Robinhood, about 30% of Robinhood revenue comes from crypto products, which I think if you told that to the average Robinhood shareholder or just the average person in traditional finance, they might be shocked about how high that number is. Where do you see the trend of that number going? Because Robinhood also has a bunch of TradFi products.
David Hoffman:
[35:33] They just launched Robinhood banking. They just launched Robinhood strategies. So it's not like neglecting by any means. It's TradFi side. But also some of these announcements are pretty amazing. So where do you see this 30% crypto revenue going in Robinhood? Do you see that increasing, staying the same?
Johann Kerbrat:
[35:50] You know, I think it's hard to say. Like, if you think about last year, we had so many great products on Robinhood, not just on the crypto side, but, you know, event, contract, future, like so many new things. And so I think it's just the business as a whole has been growing. And so that's been what's really exciting. But I think for us, what we've been mostly focused on is less about, you know, the share internally of what is Robinhood crypto doing versus the other businesses, but more like what market share we're able to get outside of Robinhood. And, you know, we've been able to grow our market share nicely in the past few quarters. And I think that's really a good signal that we are building what our customers are really excited about.
David Hoffman:
[36:26] Let's fast forward five years, 10 years, and everything that you want about your on the crypto side of Robinhood comes true. Paint us a picture of what that looks like. You have the Robinhood app. You have the Robinhood chain. You have the Bitstamp exchange. You have these tokenized equities, tokenized private companies.
David Hoffman:
[36:43] There's a big, there's a good number of puzzle pieces here. When all of these puzzle pieces that we know of come together and maybe some additional ones that we don't know of, what does that picture look like?
Johann Kerbrat:
[36:53] Well, I think, you know, for us, we've been not really keeping a lot of secrets. Like we want to make Robinhood available everywhere in the world. So that's one big thing. We have a wallet that is available in a lot of countries, but we also want to bring the entire Robinhood stack, like stocks and futures options, all these things. And the next thing also would be like, we want a lot more of the traditional system to be on chain. So ideally for me, in a few years, you use the same Robinhood that you are using today as a U.S. Customer, and most of it is using on-chain. It's a lot faster, it's instant, it's 24-7, and you don't even know it because you don't need to know all the details about the protocol.
David Hoffman:
[37:31] Do you think you guys can dethrone the NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange as the centerpiece of liquidity in the future?
Johann Kerbrat:
[37:37] Well, I think it's going to be interesting to see how the market responds to this type of assets that are being tokenized. But it is going to create a lot of opportunity. Like, you know, during market, during weekends, off market hours, all these things, like you will start to see a lot more people trading these assets.
David Hoffman:
[37:54] Will there be a token for the Robinhood chain?
Johann Kerbrat:
[37:57] Currently nothing to announce there. I think, you know, right now for us, the focus is to launch some of these new products and see how people are using it. And then we'll share more detail on that later.
David Hoffman:
[38:05] Johan, you've gotten a lot of people excited today, including myself. So thank you for all the hard work that you've been putting in. And I think we'll be watching Robinhood with pretty good interest. Thank you for having me. Cheers.
David Hoffman:
[39:50] We're here with AJ from Arbitrum.
David Hoffman:
[39:53] It's a big day for Arbitrum. How do you feel?
AJ Warner:
[39:55] Yeah, it's awesome. It's really exciting. I'm really excited to be partnering with Robinhood on this. I'm really excited about their vision, particularly about sort of reconstructing their platform for their users with CryptoRails. And yeah, it's an incredible day. I'm sure we'll get into it. But yeah, it feels kind of surreal in the moment.
David Hoffman:
[40:13] The Arbitrum-Robinhood partnership goes back pretty far, like two plus years.
David Hoffman:
[40:18] I don't know what the partnership looks like way back when. Maybe it was just an initial deal, but it's certainly crescendoed over the years to where we are today, where we are seeing Robinhood do something very innovative, which is launch stocks that are not trading on Robertium with a little Arbitrum logo right there. Talk about the crescendoing of the Robinhood-Arbitrum relationship.
AJ Warner:
[40:39] Yeah, no, it's been really cool. So I remember, I think it was ETH Denver 2024, we announced sort of like the beginning of our partnership together. And it started with like Like a really simple, like Robinhood is going to support Arbitrum in their crypto wallet, easy access for users to trade on DEXs and sort of do other activities through that wallet experience. But we sort of started like laying the building blocks for a deeper, closer relationship. Our teams got close. Joe and I in particular, you know, sort of fostered a great working relationship. And our thesis with them has always been like be good partners. You know, for us, we don't have this vision that crypto needs to be at the forefront or that arbitrage needs to be at the forefront. We're a powerful technology that can power user experiences. And for us, Robinhood sort of and its place in fintech was always the best partner. So, you know, we developed this relationship and obviously crescendoed into where we're at today. But the same like elements and thematic components of these guys are the best at building user experiences and we want our technology to be able to be flexible enough to be supportive of their vision to make their users happy.
David Hoffman:
[41:47] So I would imagine that there is not one long-standing Arbitrum Robinhood deal. There's one deal at a time and every single new thing that you guys do together has to be done on. Is this right for both of us? Do we like working together? So every single deal has to be one, right?
AJ Warner:
[42:03] Yeah, I think in many ways, like, you know, I think one of the core things that's really important for businesses that are moving as quickly as sort of both our business and their business is like flexibility to make sure that the products are right. Like, for example, today, they announced like Solana staking as well. And that's a great thing for their business. They're bringing that utility to their users. I would say tokenized stocks was always like the main prize that we were after, right? Obviously, you know, I joined crypto in 2014. And for me, it was ownership, sovereignty, and democratizing access. And there's nothing that does that more than just the tokenized access to everything. And as Vlad mentioned in phase three, the goal is for that to be, you know, self-custody, do with it what you want. And like that vision.
AJ Warner:
[42:46] Is incredible. So that was always, I would say like the North star of what we were hoping to collaborate on. And obviously that's where we're at today. And we're starting with them on Arbitrum One. So like today, for example, the demos that they did, those assets are all minting and burning on Arbitrum One and trading. Eventually they're going to be transitioning to the Robinhood chain, which the Arbitrum Orbit stack is going to power. And I think that's one of the really cool things. And one of the things that excited them about Arbitrum is the flexibility of what we can offer as a platform, right? We have Arbitrum One as a core economic hub of crypto and financial activity, and also the ability for them to take a stack and own it, own the customizations of it, whatever they want to do with it. And our team's going to be a strong partner in product design for what is the best product for their users. And there's a lot of reasons why people talk about wanting their own chain, but the ability for them to continue to compound their users on the Robinhood chain is going to be a very powerful thing as they build their hire company again on crypto rails. So again, like that flexibility of what Arbitrum can offer, I think is something that was a key component of this because the Arbitrum platform offers the flexibility that they might need in order to continue to build their
David Hoffman:
[43:59] Business on chain. Now, I think people are pretty familiar with the deal structure of base and the Optimism Collective. It's something like 15% of base sequencer fees or 2.5% of total profit, whichever one's greater, goes to the Optimism Collective. And that's kind of the deal of the Optimism Collective. Then that's kind of set the standard for the OP stack ecosystem. If you are willing to share, what are the economics of the Robinhood chain and Arbitrum?
AJ Warner:
[44:27] Arbitrum has a similar model with the DAO. It's a little bit different, but it's similar in the sense that if you want to launch an L2, which is what Robinhood is choosing to do, then you do a 10% profit share as well with the Arbitrum DAO. So it's a very similar model. I would say the differences in model are maybe some of the philosophical differences between super chain and orbit. So super chain, you kind of opt into like a shared governance model with interoperability with orbit. It's, you know, just sort of contribute back into the arbitrage and Dow on the profit share through what we call the AEP and then do whatever you want with it. Right. Right. We expect there to be interoperability, but it's almost like an orthogonal product question to use of the stack. And because we're not sort of locked in on orbit into specific, interoperability and governance mechanisms.
David Hoffman:
[45:13] We can have a lot more flexibility in design of the stack.
AJ Warner:
[45:17] So that's why you sometimes see Arbitrum, like you see L3s, you see L2s, you see custom gas tokens, you see all these different changes because the Orbit stack provides a lot more flexibility. And that was something that was like really important to Robinhood on this journey was to make sure that they had that flexibility with the stack to own it. So like they don't have to opt into shared governance or interoperability. They can if they want to.
AJ Warner:
[45:38] My suspicion is they won't prefer to, but yeah, that's how the Orbit stack structure works.
David Hoffman:
[45:43] Yeah, so it was pretty cool to see the Arbitrum logo right next to the OpenAI, you know, transfer one million shares of OpenAI in the Robinhood app that everyone's familiar with. And you see the little Arbitrum logo, as you alluded to. And as they said, you know, it starts on Arbitrum 1. It'll migrate over to the Robinhood chain when that thing is, you know, up and running. But also at the same time, Arbitrum 1 already has, you know, fantastic DeFi infrastructure, which the Robinhood chain will have to start from scratch on. I don't know if they're going to leave the option to do tokenized stocks on Robinhood Arbitrum 1 persistently. Will that always be an option?
AJ Warner:
[46:15] So it's a great question. It's really going to be up to them. I mean, the reason to do it is it's another environment where they can sort of integrate. They already have been integrated, so they don't have to uproot some of the existing established relationships that they might have on Arbitrum 1. The reason not to do it is fragmentation, potentially, of liquidity. So that's probably going to be a key product question that we're going to work on with their team over time. But, you know, I guess you said Arbitrum One has a really robust DeFi ecosystem. I'm sure a lot of our builders are going to want to work with them on the Robinhood chain as well, which is great. And something that, again, we encourage and support. I think that's probably like we don't know yet. We'll figure that out. Remember, on phase one, these assets aren't integrated yet into DeFi, right? So it's still more of a self-contained box. So today, if they migrated, they wouldn't have some of these sort of liquidity fragmentation concerns. It would probably just be some sort of mint and burn mechanism. But it probably depends on how mature and engrossed, or if there's demand for it.
David Hoffman:
[47:10] Sure, sure. You could just imagine that like there's a ton of potential TVL up for grabs. And, you know, if there's some inherent interoperability inside of the Arbitrum stack, maybe, I don't know, I can take my Robinhood tokenized stock and take it into GMX or Aave on side of Arbitrum 1. But that would necessitate transferability of these tokens. Now, you are not on the Robinhood team, so I don't know if you're privy to these details of the transferability of the Robinhood stock tokens. Do you know anything there?
AJ Warner:
[47:40] So, yeah, I don't want to speak for them. I think what Vlad was referring to is in the later phases that that isn't very much their intention. Like they want self-sovereignty. Like, so, for example, when you saw Vlad do that, like, live demo transfer, that was self-custody, right? That was not in the contained environment. Like he linked that to Arbiscan, he sent it to somebody else's wallet. So the infrastructure is already there, as they clearly showed. And I think what they're going to be planning on is, I think, figuring out the rollout. Like this is an extremely ambitious thing that they did today like yeah i think they made more announcements today than you typically see from companies in like a two or three year timeline like really incredible across so many different components but i think like again and this is sort of goes back to what i was saying about like what i really find so exciting about this they're really focused on crypto rails for their existing user base and they're going to focus on the product that will make sense for that user experience like when they were talking about the perps they said you can do this like two or three taps of the finger and like that's why i love working with this team right we're instead of saying how do we get crypto users to do more stuff on chain it's how do we get more people who are regular financial traders to be actually just using crypto rails and again i think robin hood is best positioned to be able to do that and we're extremely excited to work so closely with them when
David Hoffman:
[48:55] People are digesting this news they're just going to see the take that robin
David Hoffman:
[48:59] hood has a chain now and they're going to look at the correlates between Robinhood and Coinbase. And you're like, oh, Robinhood has their equivalent of base. And people are also going to look towards Arbitrum as well and compare that to Optimism and the OP stack. It's like, oh, Arbitrum has its equivalent of base now with Robinhood. But maybe you could also kind of continue that conversation and get into the nuances of the difference. How is it the same and how is it different? Yeah, so I.
AJ Warner:
[49:20] Think it's the same, obviously, in that we have a huge user base that's using the stack sort of exogenous to the sort of DAO-governed chain. And the reality is, is that as we see like WorldCoin, you know, Athena and Securitize are building Converge, also using the Arbitrum Orbit stack.
David Hoffman:
[49:39] There's plenty of demand for people to have their own chains.
AJ Warner:
[49:41] And that's really one of Ethereum's killer features is the flexibility and customization for that to happen. I think that there's two distinctions, I would say, sort of between the Arbitrum-Robinhood relationship. Two is like Robinhood, they have crypto users, but their core user base is not crypto. So the overlap between maybe Arbitrum 1 users and the people who are going to be the first users of the Robinhood chain are definitually probably going to be different. There's, of course, going to be on-chain activity happening from crypto natives on the Robinhood chain as well, I'm sure. But it's an additive user base. The second difference is, you know, I think especially with the expansion of time, like I think Coinbase and Optimus was probably a couple of years ago. Arbitrum 1 is very entrenched as, you know, I would argue the most credibly neutral liquid L2. Obviously, Coinbase and Base is huge. Just Arbitrum 1 and Coinbase are probably neck and neck in terms of different metrics. But Arbitrum 1 has a very strong home. if you're looking for a credibly neutral environment. And again, the way we've designed the Arbitrum path is if you want to launch an Arbitrum 1 and migrate to your own chain, it's seamless, right? That's what we're doing with Robinhood. That's what we're sort of pioneering. And I expect that journey to continue to happen for more people. Launch an Arbitrum 1, have a great experience, expand your user base, build yourself a mandate to be able to have your own chain, your own user base, and we're going to help work with you through that migration. So that's probably a little bit of the difference, but it's maybe a little more nuanced than some people might appreciate.
David Hoffman:
[51:07] I think this is going to keep people's attention focused on what exactly Robinhood is going to do on chain. How fast will the tokenized stocks come on chain? How fast will they spin up their own chain? What does Arbitrum growth look like downstream of all of this? How does Arbitrum keep this momentum going? What do you guys have next in the chamber to fire?
AJ Warner:
[51:25] Yeah, that's a great question. It's hard to beat this one, but I think that for us.
David Hoffman:
[51:29] You know, we've had a very,
AJ Warner:
[51:31] Very specific focus and thesis, which is we want to make sure our product can best serve our user base. And that user base is very broad, right? Like if you look at Arbitrum is probably most known for DeFi, both on Arbitrum 1 and also a lot of the chains that are launching using the stack. But also basically every gaming chain, for example, that launches uses Arbitrum 1. And the reason for that is because like we've had really fast block time. Sometimes you just want to use stylus because they might want to bring in traditional gaming libraries. So our goal is still like find use cases that we have conviction in. And, you know, I would say the highest conviction today is probably this merge of TradFi and DeFi into what Stephen, our CEO, likes to just say, finance. Like in 10 years, we're all just going to call it finance. That's probably our strongest focus right now, both on Arbitrum 1 and also across supporting ecosystems that want to launch their own chain. and just finding more use cases, right? We're very focused on, you know, traditional RWAs, lending, capital markets. You know, I would say Arbitrum doesn't do as well in the meme coin craze as other ecosystems. And, you know, every ecosystem sort of has their different communities and cultures,
AJ Warner:
[52:41] but this has kind of been always our focus. And during the DeFi bearer days, we probably went down with it. But, you know, as this is all coming back, I think Arbitrum's, the excitement, the euphoria for the ecosystem is coming back with it.
David Hoffman:
[52:54] Yeah, I do like that sentiment of like, you know, the OP mainnet are the governance philosophers and the base chain are like consumer crypto and crypto culture. And Arbitrum has always been DeFi and execution optimized. And so it makes sense that that's what Robinhood chooses because that's what their core product offering is. There's always there's been a there's a strong alignment between those two brands.
AJ Warner:
[53:17] Yeah, 100 percent. I think that people like to say like crypto and like TradFi or FinTech are that different. I don't think they are. I think there's a lot of cultural similarities, a lot of cultural elements. And it really all comes down to relationships, teams, and obviously product. And yeah, we've been, I think, very focused, I think, We've had a very product focused. I remember, you know, everyone talks about fast block times now. It's like the new hot thing. Arbitrum had sub 250 millisecond block times since 2021, right? And like for us, that was something we identified really early as going to be a critical thing to expand use cases. That's why Arbitrum did so well with perps as they sort of expanded off of Ethereum mainnet with, you know, GMX, Vertex, and others. And I think Stylus, which is not as popular today, is going to be that sort of next unlock. Just so in case your listeners aren't aware, Arbitrum's an EVM compatible chain, but Stylus enables you to launch contracts in Rust, C, C++, fully interoperable. So we're seeing a lot of teams now that like, you know, fintech is meeting crypto, privacy and privacy layers are really important on top of this. And Stylus enables you to have like privacy optimized because you can just pull in cryptographic libraries like super cheap, right? So we try and stay ahead of the ball in terms of what we think are the features that our users and developers are going to want and execute on that thesis.
David Hoffman:
[54:33] I do see privacy becoming increasingly important and discussed. It's starting to crescendo as a topic, especially as TradFi comes on and realizes like, oh, no, all of my assets are totally transparent to everyone. And so it's good to see that there is potential path for lots of the Arbitrum stack to also access some of the privacy that we so desperately need.
AJ Warner:
[54:54] 100%. We have like, for example, there's a team like when they launched on day one with stylus called renegade finance and it's essentially on-chain dark pools and it's the coolest thing and i think they have like more than 30 zk proofs generated on each transaction again they're doing it on arbitram it's a super cheap transaction because again they're utilizing stylus so we extended the evm we we recognized early the evm is the huge mode of the ethereum ecosystem but we can do more and that's like what the flexibility of l2s offers without compromising on the evm and we thought that you know stylus is a great a great combination there
David Hoffman:
[55:24] Cool aj Congratulations. It's been a very big day. Congratulations.
AJ Warner:
[55:27] Thank you.

4. Crypto Feels Stuck, But the Data Tells a Different Story
📖 Summary: Ryan Sean Adams:
[0:03] Bankless nation welcome to our monthly crypto fundamentals podcast we got a few topics to discuss today are we forever stuck at like 107k bitcoin 2500 eth and 150 solana feels like we've been in this zone forever we're going to talk about that also are alts the most hated asset right now and if that's the case are we actually going to get an alt rally maybe a hate rally and And where
Ryan Sean Adams:
[0:28] approximately are we in the cycle? Feels like some summertime blues, maybe. And when the bull market comes, will it actually come to our crypto native assets? Or is it all going to stocks that none of us own? We've got Michael Nato here. Mike, how you doing? Are you feeling bullish? Are you feeling bearish?
Michael Nadeau:
[0:43] Hey, Ryan, great to be here. I am feeling bullish. I think we're in an interesting spot in the markets right now. You know, Bitcoin, it sort of feels to me like Bitcoin is like a beach ball that's trying to be held under the water right now. And I think, you know, we've been trading in this range now for going on seven months, you know, seven, eight months. So that is like a very interesting setup in terms of just like we've chopped up the markets a little bit. Feels like Bitcoin is somewhat of a coiled spring, but it's still not breaking out at the same time. We are in this sort of summer months where there tends to be a little bit less volume, a little bit less interest. People are taking vacations. We have holidays next or this week. So like really near term is, I think, like kind of up in the air.
Michael Nadeau:
[1:29] But the setup to me looks very good and looking forward to getting into that in this episode.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[1:35] So guys, these episodes, Mike and I get into the on-chain data. So the analytics. This is a Crypto Fundamentals podcast and we're doing this monthly, usually the first Tuesday of every month. This is coming out on Wednesday because we had some special Robinhood things to cover that's in your podcast feed. The idea is we're trying to figure all of these things out in about 45 minutes. We're going to get you a few major investment ideas backed by this on-chain data. And at the end of the episode, Mike is going to make some calls on some assets, okay? So we're going to peek into Mike's portfolio. I'm going to ask him what he's buying, what he's selling, how his positions have moved between this episode and last episode. So all of that we're going to cover today. Mike, I just want to tee up with this. This was an article I actually read prior to this episode. that I read earlier this morning. And here's kind of the title. The Hodler's Fallacy, Rethinking Conviction in a Naturally Extractive Market. Okay, that's the title of the article. And basically the thesis is, none of this crypto asset stuff is investable. You can't really hold it long-term. The exception may be of Bitcoin and Bitcoin.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[2:39] The author says the Hodler's fallacy is the belief that in time, the market leads to long-term upside. But this article impacts why crypto rewards execution, not conviction. Crypto is pure arbitrage masquerading as an investment market. I feel like this sets the tone for how a lot of people are feeling right now, which is basically there's nothing investable in on-chain assets aside from maybe Bitcoin. It makes no sense to hold things for long-term horizon. You're a fundamentals guy. And I know part of your thesis is based on, no, there are investable assets in crypto that you can hold for years and hold for decades.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[3:18] What's your reaction to this kind of sentiment?
Michael Nadeau:
[3:20] My reaction to this kind of sentiment is that we still are in a period in crypto where these markets are still, you know, largely unregulated. And I think, you know, as we sort of move through regulation, what I expect to happen is sort of this bottoms up sort of movement amongst people like the DeFi report, others that are in the market that are trying to deeply understand how value accrues to tokens, how it accrues through the tech stack. And through that process, like we were going to, I believe, force these projects to return value to tokens. And then that's where this narrative starts to shift a little bit. But I would say it's sort of fair to look at it right now and say, like, how could you hold an altcoin? Like, how could you have a long term thesis on a lot of these things when we still aren't at a place where you can hold the UNI token, which and we know Uniswap has a fantastic protocol and it does a lot of economic activity. But can you hold that token? Do you have confidence that the value is going to go to you as a token holder and not to the equity holders? And I think this is something that regulation will suss out and these tokens will certainly, I think, be valuable in the future. And we will be able to have these more long-term thesis for how value is going to accrue to the token holder itself.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[4:41] So you feel like some of this commentary captures where we are in the market, but this is the process. This is how we figure it out. We're in this purgatory period now, and we've got to figure out what the acclaim of these assets are on productive cash flows and other fundamentals, right? That's the work we're doing here, essentially, on this episode.
Michael Nadeau:
[4:58] That's why we're here.
Ryan Sean Adams:

Ryan Sean Adams:
[7:03] It feels like it's been ranging, I don't know, for how long, but it feels like we've been here for a while between 100k Bitcoin and 110k range. What are you seeing when you look at some of these charts? I know the first one you asked me to pull up was this, which is a Bitcoin holder accumulation ratio. What are we looking at here?
Michael Nadeau:
[7:23] Yeah, some glass node data here. And, you know, I'm looking at a lot of on-chain data and trying to pair up, like, why is Bitcoin just kind of not moving? There's all these treasury companies out there starting to buy up Bitcoin. Michael Saylor and Strategy have purchased, I think, 4,000 BTC over the last few months.
Michael Nadeau:
[7:45] The macro setup looks pretty good. Like there's enough of like a hint of like that liquidity is going to be coming back. Trump won't stop talking about reducing the, you know, cutting the Fed funds rate so that we can, you know, refinance our debts. So you can kind of see that there's, you know, a pretty interesting setup out there. And I'm trying to pair that up with what I'm seeing on chain. And what we're seeing right here is just the BTC holder accumulation ratio. And it's telling us that people that already hold Bitcoin, there's more people selling their Bitcoin of the current holder base than are accumulating right now. That's that, if you look at the right side of the chart, the blue line there, that's the like 43% or so that are accumulating Bitcoin right now. So we need to see like, holders actually start to accumulate. I think a lot of people are sort of holding, expecting like another thrust here, maybe into Q4. This is showing you like the existing holders, right? So if existing holders are not going to step into the market, we need new money to come in. And that's sort of like what that's telling me right now. It's important to remember that this on-chain data from Glassnode does not pick up the ETFs, which ETFs are holding roughly 6% or so of the supply. It's also not picking up what's on exchanges. And I think when you add those two up, it's about 18%.
Michael Nadeau:
[9:06] So we factor that into this when we look at this data. But it's just telling us that existing holders were actually most bullish in the beginning of last year, actually. And so I think this explains a little bit of why price is just kind of ranging a little bit right now. Okay.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[9:23] So this is telling the story because this has been down since what you said was the beginning of last year. And what do you want to see from this, this blue line here that is creeping down towards 40%? Do you want to start seeing it kind of like ebb up? What would make you bullish in this indicator?
Michael Nadeau:
[9:37] Yeah, I would expect that, you know, let's say, you know, Powell comes out and we start to see like a little bit of a shift from like a more hawkish stance towards like it's becoming more clear that we're going to see rate cuts maybe July. It could take until September. But I think if the market starts to sniff that out, I think existing holders will get back into the market and also new money will come back in and you'll see that line shoot up a little bit. But like I said at the beginning, we're in the summer months where people are enjoying their lives a little bit more and less glued to their screens buying crypto right now.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[10:16] So you want to see this holders start to accumulate more. Here's another indicator, which I think shows holder metrics. So this is the number of addresses with a balance above 10,000 Bitcoin. That's quite a hefty balance. So is this kind of some sort of a whale indicator here? And we're seeing this purple line here, which seems to oscillate around the number 100. What are we looking at here?
Michael Nadeau:
[10:39] Yeah, exactly. These are the largest whales in terms of the cohorts of holders of Bitcoin. And this just also sort of explains why price is just having a tough time breaking out, I think, because this cohort has been selling really over the last few years or so. So, you know, they're scaling out. This is not like a massive, there's only a hundred. And when we started this cycle, there were 120, you know, holders of greater than 10,000 Bitcoins.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[11:08] Oh, it's like 120 addresses that have over 10,000 Bitcoin. You're tracking all these big whale addresses then.
Michael Nadeau:
[11:15] Exactly. And that's down, you know, it's under a hundred now. So, so we've lost some of the, you know, largest holders are now under that threshold. So it just tells you like, okay, like.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[11:26] You know, we know the conditions look pretty bullish out there, but there are people that have been, if you own 10,000 BTC, you're probably in very early.
Michael Nadeau:
[11:33] And so you still have some of that sort of sell pressure. People that are up, you know, tens of thousands of percentage on their Bitcoin are happy to sell, you know, 100K Bitcoin.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[11:44] So this is another indicator of that you're looking at kind of long-term holders. So this is Bitcoin long-term holder supply, and you've got Bitcoin price in orange, and And then you have the long-term holder supply in purple here. So what are we looking at? What does this tell you?
Michael Nadeau:
[12:00] Yeah, this is on sort of on the other side of this. So the first two charts are kind of telling me, okay, this makes a little sense of why we're seeing price just kind of range bound. This is a positive indicator to me. So that long-term holder supply is now back to all-time highs. We saw a dip in that. So long-term holders were taking some profits earlier this year. And we've seen basically them step back into the market as buyers. In some cases, that line will come up just if people came into the market, even if they came into the market at the all-time highs and they just didn't sell, they become long-term holders over a period. So it's sort of the reaction of that time and it's also long-term holders adding to their wallets. But that to me is, this is very positive. This is like 74% of the supply is now held by long-term holders. And that's usually a pretty good base for like if we see speculation come back into the market, then you get the new money coming in, the short-term holders. So that's what I'm looking for, you know, as we move through the summer months here.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[13:02] Okay, and then how about this one to round out the Bitcoin story here? Liquid supply, what's this?
Michael Nadeau:
[13:07] Same idea, a long-term hold. This is bullish to me. So a liquid supply is at an all-time high as well. And what this is doing, Glassnode is just basically looking at, all the wallets that have held Bitcoin and determining based on how much they're buying and selling, like are these illiquid wallets. And so it's kind of like looking at all the on-chain data to tell us that, hey, like most of the supply looks like it's in strong, you know, diamond hands right now. And so again, that's another bullish indicator. And like when we see like big moves in Bitcoin, you do see that line kind of oscillate down a little bit because people are moving their coins to exchanges to cash out. So it feels like we were setting a very strong base is kind of, I think, the key takeaway for some of this data.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[13:58] Okay. So when you add all this together, you're seeing a strong base, maybe a pause in terms of long-term holder accumulation, but it's still pretty high and the long-term holders are still holding. And after all, that's what seems to drive Bitcoin price, right?
Ryan Sean Adams:
[14:14] It's just like more people holding it as a store of value asset over time and not selling. And then when you have that effect, you see Bitcoin price rise so long as you have net new sources of demand.
Michael Nadeau:
[14:28] Exactly. That's it. And I think the market is waiting to see what Mr. Powell is going to do and who's going to win this fight between Trump and Powell. And I think that's, That's the final domino, I think, to go. Everything else looks pretty well set up to me.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[14:44] I know we'll get your insights in macro towards the end of this, but it does seem like pressure is mounting on Powell or whoever his successor is, right? Which could be like a real fact in this situation here. But let's turn to some of our other bags. So if Bitcoin's in kind of a hold place, but you're expecting, you know, like further increase, further accumulation, price appreciation, what about altcoins? So I think last time we had this discussion of like, when is alt season? What are you seeing in the metrics here? I know Bitcoin dominance is like creeping to all time highs, maybe like 20. Was it 2020?
Ryan Sean Adams:
[15:23] Where it was really an all time high into like the 70% type range, something like that. Now we're in the 60s, mid 60%. I feel like with Bitcoin dominance, something in that range. But you are showing a chart here which is the altcoin season index and this oscillates between a band that says you know like it's more bitcoin season versus oh in orange it's bitcoin season i suppose and then in kind of this blue hue we're moving to altcoin season we are squarely in orange in june like in july of 2025 earlier in this year it actually dipped into altcoin territory at least according to this index so what do you see when you look at this chart and like what even is this chart.
Michael Nadeau:
[16:04] Yeah. The reason I like this one is it's giving you a relative performance in terms of the prices of altcoins versus Bitcoin. It's factoring in the market caps. It's factoring in trading volume of the large cap versus the altcoins. And it also looks at social indicators as well. And so it's kind of giving you a broad view of sentiment on altcoins. And yeah, we're in Bitcoin zone right now. And what I like to just, I try to observe the market, like, so look at the data and then observe what you see on like crypto Twitter. And like most of the, when you get into this, this type of market structure.
Michael Nadeau:
[16:45] People start to think that like the alts are never coming back and this is just a Bitcoin cycle and the Bitcoiners were right. And so to me, like that always, there's always going to be like another rotation after that. And so my view is that altcoins are pretty hated right now, sentiment very low on altcoins. I think there's a few things we could sort of look at to say like why that's the case.
Michael Nadeau:
[17:14] And an interesting data point came out with the Robinhood partnership with Arbidrum. Just seeing Robinhood move like 15% a day on that news, but not seeing the same reaction on ETH or some of the other animal spirits that you might look for on chain. We haven't seen that, but we're seeing it almost from TradFry and Wall Street. We saw it with Circle as well. So I think there's something going on here where alt season is looking like it may be inspired by Wall Street this cycle. We got a glimpse of that with Circle. We got a glimpse of it again yesterday with Robinhood. Coinbase has been doing very well as well of late. And so, you know, this is something to factor in. We have like, I think, nine altcoin ETFs coming this summer. And so, you know, that could be the thing that sort of helps to kick off the actual sort of longer tail of crypto assets outside of the equities itself. But yeah, for me, like, you know, I always want to be zigging when everyone else is zagging. And I think this is one of those opportunities for select altcoins right now.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[18:26] So you think there will be an altcoin season?
Michael Nadeau:
[18:29] I do. You know, not the same way what we saw like in 21, but I definitely think that quality assets will outperform Bitcoin. And I expect ETH to outperform Bitcoin.
Michael Nadeau:
[18:40] You know, for a period as well.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[18:42] So yeah, it's interesting because in 21, right, some of that altcoin energy, let's say went into the NFT market. And some of those NFTs guys, like they're just not coming back. All right. So but this brings like the whole question of when you say alts, what alts are you talking about? And I think I mentioned last episode, I'm, I'm still haunted by Arthur Hayes, like you like it did an episode with him and, and talking about Yeah, there'll be an alt season, but it may not be your alts. So it's kind of like choose your alts carefully. When you talk about alts, are you basically talking about everything south of Bitcoin? Is that an alt? Because I know you've got some bellwether assets, let's call them, that we're about to take a look at, Ether and Solana. I would imagine, like to you, these are in the kind of alt, non-Bitcoin territory. But there's a whole lot of other assets, even in the crypto top 20, even in the crypto top 10. And so this still happens to me, Mike. I still get texts from retail investors who are not plugged into crypto. I'll call them normies, but I don't want to be derogatory to normal people. And they're like, hey, what do you think about XRP? I know you're into crypto. What do you think about Ripple and XRP? And I just don't have much commentary on that. It doesn't hit my rubric for fundamentals. It's not on my radar very much. Is XRP in alts? Is Cardano in alts? Is BNB in alts? Is Litecoin in alts? Like, what's an alt to you?
Ryan Sean Adams:
[20:12] Yeah, it's a great question.
Michael Nadeau:
[20:13] It's a good, I think a good lead in here. Like the way I think of it is, yeah, basically anything outside of Bitcoin, I would consider like an alt. And for me, like what I've historically done well with in my portfolio is having an allocation, most of my allocation to the top three, like, you know, crypto networks, BTC, ETH, and SOL. And then looking for high beta on the other side of that to sort of like I like to think of it as like you're capturing it's almost like a little hot sauce on the portfolio.
Michael Nadeau:
[20:45] Where if you do it in percentage like a smaller percentage it tends to not like add too much to the volatility of the portfolio and so like sharp ratios and things are pretty interesting when you look at the relationship in the beta of like a meme coin, to like ETH, you know, or like just to Sol. So that's how I think of altcoins. Like, you know, XRP is not something I've ever held. I think you have to respect the Ripple army and just like what's happening there. And the reason I've never held it is I've never been able to get, like everything that I do is informed by data. And so I've never been able to get any data on the Ripple chain. On-chain data specifically for you. On-chain data. So yeah, and they don't, you know, I don't, maybe there is some data out there that I'm not aware of, but as far as I know, none of the data providers have data on them. I think it's essentially a meme coin to me, but like I said, you got to respect what they're doing and there's. There's a lot of people that believe in that. So, you know, but yeah, I think for us, it's mostly like things that are longer, farther down the risk curve that we can develop a thesis for is essentially, and that we can look at data that tells us something interesting, like there's high beta to the L1. And that's how we do the analysis.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[22:05] So I guess this gets us into your head a little bit and your kind of investment style, which is basically like for you and the DeFi report, in order to capture the alt season upside, You don't have to own every alt.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[22:17] So what you do is you own alts that you see fundamentals in, strong fundamentals, on-chain data in. But then you kind of lever up a little bit and you capture the beta on those alts through other tokens. That's essentially the Mike Nato strategy here.
Michael Nadeau:
[22:33] That's the Mike Nato strategy right there. All right.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[22:36] Well, let's talk about some of those maybe bellwether alts with good on-chain data. And you've got a few charts here. We're talking about what is fair value for
Ryan Sean Adams:
[22:45] something like Ether right now and Solana. And again, recognizing this is a chaotic market, we're all trying to figure out what layer ones are actually worth, and that's an ongoing discussion. But tell me about this metric. So this is market value to realized value, and you've got both ETH, MVRV, and Solana MVRV, one of them in purple, one of them in this pink color, ETH in purple, Solana in this pink. What are we looking at here? What does this chart tell you?
Michael Nadeau:
[23:11] Yeah, so this is looking at, so market value to realized value. Realized value is a proxy for the cost basis of the network. And, you know, when I'm in the market looking to buy tokens, I'm trying to figure out if these, is it at fair value? And like one way to think of this, it's almost like if you're going to analyze a stock or an equity and you saw that it was trading near its book value, right? Sort of like the actual stock price is where it's trading at the sum of all the assets. You know you're kind of getting fair value at that point. And so trying to find ways to think about fair value, we don't have book value for these. These are software, but we have ways to think about it. And so one way to think about fair value is to look at the cost basis of all the tokens in circulation, and then where are you trading relative to that? So both of these are just over one, which is telling you that on average, the average ETH holder or SOL holder, on average again, is sort of like just above water on their holdings.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[24:20] Break even on their cost basis? Yes. So they bought ETH, they bought Sol at whatever price they bought it, and they're basically flat. They're not down. They're not up on average. They're just kind of flat.
Michael Nadeau:
[24:30] That's right. And when you see that line, so when you see the pink line sort of in the middle of the chart there, that was the last bear market. When you see that go under one, those are typically... Back the truck up moment.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[24:44] We're close to one right now. We're not under one, but we're close to one for both ETH and SOL.
Michael Nadeau:
[24:49] Yeah. And ETH was under one, you know, during the sort of tariff wars around April. And so- When it.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[24:57] Dipped at like 1,500, right? Yep.
Michael Nadeau:
[24:59] Yeah. So that was a really good opportunity to buy ETH. We might not see that again, you know, possibly ever, you know, we'll see. But I think, you know, this is one way that we sort of develop conviction around, okay, we have conviction about the macro setup. And then we start to look at these types of metrics to say, okay, this is a good time to buy.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[25:19] I like that. I'm a fan of this metric. And other times when ETH and SOL have been below one, it's like SOL fell way below one back in the post FTX, like 2022, 2023 bear, of course, you could see. And ETH less so, but also a little bit. And then you can also see these times when market value realized value was just like well above two, three, four for both these assets. And that's when you start to see like frothy assets. Basically, the holders are way up. You know, they're 2x up, they're 3x up, they're 5x up on average. And that's where you start to see the froth. But right now, it is not looking frothy for ETH and Sol. It's looking like kind of like accumulation territory historically. I'm wondering, like this metric kind of reminds me of, You remember that episode we did with Jonah on Bankless, which was like MSOV, or sorry, RSOV, realized store of value, right? This kind of reminds me of realized store of value. Is it the same kind of metric or in the family of realized store of value metrics?
Michael Nadeau:
[26:22] It is, yeah. The way he's using this with ETH and Sol to get to the RSOV is he's looking at the realized value of the ETH that is actually staked. And so what that's doing is it's like it's taking the value of ETH when the asset is actually moved into a staking contract. And it's taking the sum of all that to say like this is the...
Ryan Sean Adams:
[26:43] Staked and also in DeFi, right? So he's taking the cost basis.
Michael Nadeau:
[26:46] Yeah, and he's got ETH and DeFi. Exactly. Yep. Right. Those two, which, you know, and I think since Bitcoin doesn't have the DeFi elements, he's just using the Bitcoin's realized value to kind of get to there. So the other thing I'll add to this is we also look at the Z-score of these metrics. So the Z-score is telling you how many standard deviations you are from the historical average price. It's fascinating that both Ethan Sol are actually sort of mirroring each other here, but they're both around like 0.3 above their standard deviation, which again is pretty fair zone.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[27:25] I actually really like this metric. I'm a big fan of this metric for like buying opportunities. Let's look at another one, which is FD market cap. So I guess that's fully diluted market cap versus TVL. And this is for Ether, the asset. And let's see, what we're looking at is the Ethereum ecosystem total value locked in purple here. So I imagine this is the value of all assets, including ETH, on-chain, in just Ethereum mainnet, or does this include layer twos, Mike?
Michael Nadeau:
[27:53] It's including just ETH mainnet. Just ETH mainnet.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[27:57] Okay. And then that's in purple. And then pink is just the fully diluted market cap. And so tell us what we're seeing here.
Michael Nadeau:
[28:06] Yeah. This is, again, just searching for signals of when we think it's fair value. And what's interesting about this chart is like you can see that the market value of ETH like has bottomed when it's sort of touched the TVL, the ecosystem TVL. So and we just had one, you know, we had that in April as well. So you can see those two arrows there pointing to like these bottoms. I think this is just a fascinating thing. Maybe TV, maybe ecosystem TVL is book value, right? Like it's that's kind of how I'm thinking about it.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[28:41] I've seen reports like this and I've seen investors and analysts and even kind of like quant style. Investors like look at this metric, right? And there's definitely some correlation here. And so what this means is I suppose if TVL grows and let's say Ethereum TVL is kind of a bottom floor for the value of the network, as this maybe chart seems to indicate there's some correlation here, like, you know, at least, then you start to get some proxies of, well, if stablecoin growth, you know, exceeds 300 billion, 500 billion goes like up towards a trillion. Right. And a lot of that's on Ethereum. Then that starts to set the floor for what the value of the network should be. Is that how you
Michael Nadeau:
[29:22] Think about it? That's exactly right. And I think it's important to hone in on the stablecoin piece there because, you know, the assets that are in DeFi, like TVL that's in DeFi, like the TV, it's reflexive to the price, right? There's a lot of ETH involved in there. So all the assets, if ETH goes down in price, you know, TVL is going to drop as well. So they sort of move together, but stable coins are sort of holding more of a base there. And so maybe stable coins actually become.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[29:49] The sort of book value at some point. And because we know that that's not moving as much.
Michael Nadeau:
[29:54] But yeah, just another metric where if we know we're getting close to that line, then it kind of tells you it's a decent buying opportunity, I think.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[30:02] Yeah. And with Ethereum, you have six years of data on this, right? So that's kind of nice. Now let's talk about this one, the 200-week moving average. So this is kind of a long-term TA type of chart. What's this showing you?
Michael Nadeau:
[30:14] Yeah, long-term. So this is like almost a four-year moving average and similar this this works for bitcoin as well when when you drop below that four-year moving average tends to be a really good buying opportunity we we dropped significantly below it in april so that looks that just again looks like a really good buying opportunity back then still we're we're just below it right now so you know still looks like we were in a pretty good buying zone to be honest that that's that's what that's telling me right there and it just historically worked pretty well.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[30:48] What's interesting about this is the numbers, the on-chain numbers that you're highlighting are indicating that it's a good buying zone, right? It's certainly not a bad buying zone. It doesn't feel like it's a good buying zone, like from a sentiment perspective. And maybe that's the exact reason you need to be looking at buying, right? Because blood in the streets, most hated assets. This is, of course, if these assets were doing very well, we would be on the other side of these charts and it wouldn't be a buying opportunity. So the fact that it feels like it's a bad time to buy is maybe the reason you should consider it once you look at this on-chain data, which brings us maybe to the sauce, right? If you want to kind of lever up on some of these alt plays, the beta type assets. So we talked about ETH and SOL as alt Bitcoin assets, but on top of that, you can capture some additional beta. I guess, give me the take for like why you even want beta style assets and like why can't we just like why not just why do you not just capture the full value of kind of like your your takes here and your investment in these alternative assets directly why even go down the stack to these beta assets so
Michael Nadeau:
[32:00] I guess this is a personal question and if people are not as involved and like they don't they're not spending as much time studying the markets and being really involved i probably recommend just buying the majors. But this is really more for if you want to take a little bit more risk, right? So these are high beta assets, meaning they will go up significantly more than their sort of L1 pair, but they will also go down significantly more if the L1 pair does not do well. And so for me, the way that I've constructed our portfolio in the past and what I'm.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[32:35] Because if I
Michael Nadeau:
[32:36] Have conviction that ETH is going to do well, that Sol is going to do well, I then try to find a high beta pairing with that so that I can sort of, I described it as like a little hot sauce, you know, on the portfolio. And, you know, we're in crypto. Like we should be, if you're in crypto, you are probably more of a risk taker than the average sort of market participant. And so we like risk, right? We like to take some risks. We like to have some fun. And so that's kind of the thinking behind these high beta assets. And, you know, we've put out reports on this as well. We go through like how we actually do this analysis. And as long as I can look at data that can give me some sort of conviction, then it's something I can participate in. And so that's sort of the view on these memes. Pepe, like I've said in the past, if you think the ETH is going to do well, Pepe is probably going to do well as well. and probably potentially go up multiples on ETH.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[33:37] So that's some of the hot sauce. We'll talk about some of that. But one of them is just like, and this might surprise people, is Pepe. You think that's hot sauce to ETH basically. And the reason you derive that view is from these two charts here. So Pepe, market value to realized value ratio. Nice thing, of course. It's a meme, but it's all on chain. So Mike can peek into the data. Like what about these charts is indicating that this is beta for ETH?
Michael Nadeau:
[34:02] Yeah. So we were just looking at this for Sol and ETH. And we were saying that when you get under one, that's typically a really good buying opportunity. With Pepe, you get a little bit further below one because of the volatility of this. And you can see we've been down to 0.5 a few times in the full history of Pepe as a tradable asset. We are close to that same level right now. So again, this is telling you that the average Pepe holder is underwater right now. So if you're wondering why the sentiment is so bad on crypto Twitter, it's because people are losing money. And that's, as a contra signal, that's, to me, that's a signal to buy Pepe, potentially. You know, I'm not going all in, but I think it's okay to be nibbling on these things sort of at these levels.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[34:51] So let me ask you about something like this versus a strategy to just do some kind of Look, I do not advocate for leverage, right? Just like in general, margin crypto is just, I mean, that's like, you know, strapping a bomb to your chest and then going skydiving. It's like generally a really bad idea, but that can add some hot sauce to a portfolio. So why do something like Pepe rather than kind of like a 2x, 3x levered bet, some sort of perp trade on Ether or Sol?
Michael Nadeau:
[35:21] Because I don't want to get liquidated. That's really it. That's really it. You just want to survive. Yeah, and I don't do leverage. So, and that's a personal choice as well. But I think if you are somebody who's comfortable doing that, you sort of get the same, you get the same output. For me, I'm more comfortable just buying the meme coin than putting leverage on to EtherSoul. And so that's how I play it. I just think it's a little safer than risking a liquidation. And I always want to be long the crypto asset class. I don't want to risk. I just don't want to risk that. So that's, again, another personal decision.

We got some sriracha sauce over here, which is some of these other crypto assets that aren't meme-stocked. They do have some different style on-chain fundamentals, maybe access to some future cash flow, one of which is Athena and E&A, which is the asset of Athena. You wrote this memo. I thought it was fantastic. It was back in June. It's all on the DeFi report, guys, so you can check here. But this is an asset I believe that you are bullish on, Mike. Can you tell us why?
Michael Nadeau:
[38:02] Yeah. So there's a little bit of a stablecoin meta, I think, that you can capture.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[38:09] I've noticed, I've noticed with the circle price.
Michael Nadeau:
[38:11] Yes, circle's doing really well.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[38:14] We just really like the team behind this project.
Michael Nadeau:
[38:17] What's fascinating about this is it's essentially a hedge fund. And this is going to be interesting to see how regulation, we can get into regulation with this, but it's essentially a hedge fund. And the way that I think of this is they're democratizing access to that hedge fund and anybody can participate in this. And it has this reflexive nature to it where the yield that is being paid to holders of the stablecoin, you can capture yield. This is a yield-bearing stablecoin. I think there may be an issue with them calling it a stablecoin potentially with regulation, but for now it's a yield-bearing stablecoin.
Michael Nadeau:
[38:56] And the way that it pays that yield is when you are in a risk-on environment, funding rates. So if Ethereum sees a move towards $3,000, $4,000, what we will see is open interest rise, right? Traders will get into the market. They will want to put on leverage. And so what Athena is doing is essentially shorting ETH when that happens, and the longs are paying Athena to have that position open, and then they're sharing that, the yield of that with the stablecoin holders. So it's a very reflexive play on ETH itself, which also means there's risks there. If ETH goes in the wrong direction, and, you know, open interest costs.
Michael Nadeau:
[39:39] Comes down, there could be an issue there, which we highlighted as one of the major risks. We cover a lot of the risks with this project in particular. But to me, this is a bull market play. It's probably not a long-term hold through the bear market, but it's a reflexive play on ETH. And it's not a meme coin. It actually has fundamentals. It has yield that goes to those stablecoin holders.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[40:04] So let's talk about this a little bit more. I think the mechanism itself is a little difficult to understand. And maybe we could talk about that. Let's park the mechanism aside. My understanding, Mike, is this is Athena now, the stablecoin itself, so not the kind of the token that's the recipient of future cash flows, the ENA token, but the Athena stablecoin token itself, is it the third largest stablecoin?
Michael Nadeau:
[40:28] It is. Yeah, it is. The largest yield-bearing stablecoin. It has about 50% of the yield-bearing stablecoin market.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[40:36] Wow. Okay, so stable coins, number one is, of course, like Tether. And we'll call this a stable coin for now. So number one is Tether. Number two is Circle USDC. And we've seen what Circle is doing. And we know the profit margins on Tether. We just talked to Apollo, Mike. I don't know if you caught up with that episode. But do you know they're throwing off, I don't know, 13 billion or so in profit every year? In profit. And he expects to do more this year. Anyway, massively profitable. Also have some narrative tailwinds, say, with the Genius Act. And this is the number three stablecoin, okay? It's still not huge in comparison, but it's respectable. What are we at? Six billion or so in terms of the total amount of these stablecoins that have been issued? Okay. Yeah. Massive. And they were the,
Michael Nadeau:
[41:25] I think the second fastest protocol to over a hundred million dollars in protocol revenue as well.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[41:30] Okay. So we have that, we have kind of the narrative. Now what's interesting too, is I don't know if this is good or bad, but the Genius Act doesn't contemplate something like Athena, right? So it doesn't, it doesn't, from my understanding, it doesn't rule one way or another on Athena, right? But in the Genius Act, there's like no contemplation of a yield-bearing stablecoin. USDC does not have a path to do that. Neither does Tether. So the fact that this is stablecoin with yield, that goes back to kind of the holder of USDE, that's kind of something different than the other top two stablecoins. Now, something else that's different, I suppose, is it doesn't have the blessing from this regulation. So it kind of exists in this regulatory gray area. Am I right about this?
Michael Nadeau:
[42:15] Yes, that is correct. And that's how they've been performing over the last few years.
Michael Nadeau:
[42:21] And the Genius Act sort of says, hey, we realize there's these other stable coins out there. We want to study them for a year or so, and then we will come up with a framework for those. But for now, they are outside of the Genius Act. I think what people can get maybe a little comfort around is the fact that this is not a SEC regime that is necessarily probably going to go after them for being outside of that framework. It's more just that you just have to operate offshore. You don't get to be blessed by the U.S. capital markets. You're just going to have to operate offshore. And they have to sort of geofence the actual app to U.S. users. People use VPNs and things like that. But that's sort of where they sit. And, you know, they've been able to achieve the amount of success they've had, you know, in this current state of being in this gray area. And I.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[43:12] Think it'll just
Michael Nadeau:
[43:13] Sort of continue for a little while.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[43:15] How scalable is the stablecoin itself? And by scalable, I mean, how big could it grow? So we're at 6 billion now, but to get to Tether's level, you're 150 billion. It's somewhat easy for Tether to scale. If there's a dollar of demand for Tether, they just buy more treasuries and they just scale it that way. Same thing with USDC. So it's infinitely scalable with demand. Some of these other stablecoin projects that are based on collateral, this type of thing, something like make or die, for instance, it's just harder to scale because you have to have collateral that kind of backs it. You have to have demand for leverage essentially that backs those types of stable coins. This uses a different mechanism, I believe, but it does have some scale limitations, right? Is it the amount of perps in circulation or what are the scale limitations of Athena? It does.
Michael Nadeau:
[44:04] Yeah, it's a great question. So the limitations in scaling this is really the amount of open interest on Ethereum and these other crypto assets that they essentially short to pay the yield. And they can't, based on sort of the risk parameters of the protocol, they can't have more than like 20% of the open interest. It just gets too risky. I see. And so they are constrained by this. I would say that in a bull market, what I think that constraint, just sort of the ceiling of that constraint sort of rises as open interest comes in. But there is a constraint there. I would say that they are diversifying their reserves as well. So they do have the BlackRock Biddle money market fund that is also backing. So they have some interesting TradFi integrations and they work with, they're building an L3 with Securitize and BlackRock. And that's a real world asset platform for issuing assets. They're building that with Securitize, they're using the BlackRock biddle, which is treasury bonds, to sort of diversify some of the risk in some of the reserves there as well. So that constraint, you know, the way that I think of it is like, based on where I think open interest can go in this cycle, I think it can get to 20 trillion, or sorry, 20 million. Oh, okay.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[45:23] Wow, I was going to say, wow, that's bullish. 20 billion in open interest. And so Athena could capture all of that potentially?
Michael Nadeau:
[45:32] Yeah. So I think they could get to 20 billion of stablecoin supply. They're about six right now. And if that were to happen, I would expect the token to rally as well. And we can get into fair value on the token. It looks similar to me, like as these memes that we were just talking about. I think it's down almost 80% from its all-time high right now. Wow. Wow. And the fundamental look great. So.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[45:56] Well, okay. One question before we get to maybe the fair value is you mentioned risk a couple of times, okay? And I'm just like, you don't have to explain all of kind of the risk here, but I want to get your sense of the spectrum, right? So if on the one hand, on the not risky side, we have something like Circle and Tether, which is backed by a treasury, not risky. On the other side of the spectrum, people remember 2022, and they remember Terra Luna, algo stablecoin, backed by endogenous collateral of the asset itself, kind of this recursive pyramid scheme-y thing that can unwind in a hurry. Where are we? Are we somewhere in between those two ends of the spectrum?
Michael Nadeau:
[46:36] Yeah, I think that's fair. This is not a pyramid scheme type thing, but it also has not been tested in a bear market. And what that would look like is funding rates actually going negative for a period of time. And they make their money by shorting ETH when funding rates are positive. And so I do think there's risks here that we just haven't seen how it's going to perform. They also have custody risk, right? They work with exchanges and they've done a lot of stuff to try to get some of the reserves and stuff off exchange so that they don't have this counterparty risk. They did have $30 million with Bybit when Bybit was hacked earlier this year. They did fine through that. But there's sort of like the counterparty custody risk. There's the protocol risk itself in terms of just the smart contracts functioning properly.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[47:31] And then you have this peg risk in terms of the market conditions and funding rates,
Michael Nadeau:
[47:36] I think are like the three primary risks. These things won't show up, most likely in a bull market, but they will show up in a bear market.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[47:45] This feels to me like it's slightly, definitely not Lunaterra territory, but slightly maybe more risky than something like DAI, which has sustained through multiple bear markets in the past.
Michael Nadeau:
[47:56] Yeah, agreed.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[47:57] Okay, fair market value of this thing, what do you think? Right now, it's what, 25 cents for ENA right now?
Michael Nadeau:
[48:04] 25 cents or so. It's down. It's similar to what we were looking at before. When you look at the MBRV of this, it's down. I can't remember where it was when I shared that report, but it's close to one, below one, and I might have had it in the closing. Yeah, there it is, MBRV. Yeah, so we're negative on the MBRV Z score. That's telling you where it's trading in relation to its historical norms. So it's trading, I think, almost 0.5 standard deviations below its average price. So that's telling you it's oversold, basically, right now. It does have token, it has unlocks, right? So this is part of the analysis we share in this report. And that's another one of the risks is team unlocks. And so I think that's putting pressure on it during this sort of risk-off phase of the market that we're kind of in right now.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[49:01] And is there a fee switch on or not yet?
Michael Nadeau:
[49:04] Not yet. So the cash flow situation. They have hinted at this. There's a few, and we cover this in the report, there's a few thresholds that they want to reach in terms of risk parameters, in terms of total protocol fees and things like this before they actually turn on the fee switch to the ENA token. But it's on the roadmap.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[49:24] Okay. All right, so that's Athena, guys. I know you also, Mike, have a position in WorldCoin. We talked a little bit about that last time. There's a full report on the DeFi report that people can go get Mike's take on WorldCoin. I want to zoom out and ask more of a meta question on sort of alt season. You were talking about it a little bit earlier. Like, what if alt season happens, but it's with crypto equities and stocks rather than on-chain assets? So what we've seen this week is a Robinhood rollout of tokenized securities on top of Arbitrum. Arbitrum got like the ARB token got a little bit of a bump on that. Robinhood also got an 11% bump on that. What happened to ETH? Nothing. Purgatory.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[50:08] It's like it's operating like a stable coin this summer. 2,500. That's all. I wake up, I see 2,500. I go to bed, I see 2,500. Rinse, watch, repeat the full cycle. So that is not filtering into some of our crypto native assets. We've seen Circle. People sideways on Circle, the crypto natives at least, because they own on-chain
Ryan Sean Adams:
[50:26] assets. And where do you buy Circle on-chain? It's not in Uniswap. Well, at least not now. Maybe it will be someday soon. And that's seen at 8x from IPO at some point in the time. So now if you're considering fundamental crypto assets do investors need to look outside of on chain assets and look at actual traditional crypto equities that benefit from the crypto like things like hood things like coin things like circle i mean let's ignore the treasury companies right now because those are levered bets on crypto native assets but like the crypto equities do we need to start looking in public markets for these things
Michael Nadeau:
[51:03] I think so. I think you have to pay attention to what we're seeing here. Like the Circle IPO was pretty eye-opening for me to observe just the amount of demand for that. And we're seeing coin sort of catch up a little bit now. Robinhood has done extremely well. Like you really have to pay attention when Robinhood goes up 11% on announcing news that they're building on Ethereum, but Ethereum doesn't move. Arbitron moved a little bit. You got to pay attention, I think, to that. It doesn't tell me anything long-term or where this is all going, but I recommend, we've been holding coin and hood since the last bear market, and we will continue to do that. Basically, there's eight assets in our portfolio. That's two of them. So a quarter of the portfolio is in these equities. What I'm looking at is these ETFs. We do have nine altcoin ETFs coming. Yeah. To me, that's bullish for all coins, right? And the fact that this is happening and then this becomes the narrative.
Michael Nadeau:
[52:07] Like I sort of want to fade that a little bit. It's like sort of telling me like maybe this is getting a little too, people are getting a little too caught up in this. And like there's still, you always have to come back to like, you know, people love to gamble. We are, there's a lot of DGENs and crypto. And like, I just think people will chase things. But you need to see sort of a change in, I think, the liquidity conditions, and we can maybe get into a little bit of that at the end here. But altcoins, ETH, BTC, chart, all of these things really depend on Fed liquidity. And so that's the key thing.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[52:43] Yeah, one thing I appreciate about that perspective, and I do think people need to be looking at crypto equity assets, is it resolves some of the challenges that we've had with our tokens in the past, which is like some of our tokens have been, and people have called them lemon market tokens, but like almost like pseudo equity. We're like, do you have a right to cash flow? Do you have a right to governance? Is the team incentivized behind this like singular asset or they have multiple assets? Could they just like abandon the project? All of those protections have already been worked out over the last, what, like 80 years in Gary Gensler style. I'm going to invoke his name. But like the SEC and crypto and sorry, U.S. Equities markets have worked out all of these kinks. And when you own when you own stock in Robinhood and Coinbase, the teams around those have a fiduciary responsibility to return value to shareholders and to maximize that value. And that's like in the legal code of the U.S. So it's kind of nice to be dabbling in those crypto assets too, because they don't have the problem that many of our tokens have. But let's end this episode with liquidity and the macro setup. So you've got a chart here with weekly global liquidity. And tell us about this. And what do you see in liquidity? Why is that a driver for you of the macro conditions?
Michael Nadeau:
[54:05] Yeah, this is from cross-border capital where we source this from. What we're seeing here is like it's just turned over a little bit in June. And this is, to me, this is just the Fed sitting on its hands. And so we know that there's quite a bit of fiscal spend going on. We'll see what happens with the big, beautiful bill. Like it looks like it might have hit a little snag recently here. So that's a big deal in terms of what's going to happen there. And then what is Powell going to do? I mean, Powell, he spoke, I think, in Europe yesterday, and I thought maybe we would see him hint at like a sort of shift, but still hawkish, still saying that they're going to be data dependent, concerned about inflation. If you look at the CME futures in terms of where the market is pricing rate cuts, it's at like, I think it was less than 20% for July. I think it was 18% the last time I looked. It looks better for September. So it looks like it might be a 75% chance of cuts in September.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[55:05] Really?
Michael Nadeau:
[55:06] And actually, what was interesting was like, it looked like a 20% chance of a 50 basis point cut in September. You can see like, this is telling you that the Fed is, what I think.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[55:19] Is going to
Michael Nadeau:
[55:19] Happen is they're just going to be behind this. If you're data dependent, you're basically saying we're going to be late. So this is a risk in the market right now. Like it's easy to look at a lot of things and be bullish. But the longer they go, the higher the chances are that you have something, some snag in the repo markets or some scare in the markets. You know, last August, we had the Japanese carry trade unwind in early August. So like kind of just be aware that liquidity conditions are not like really good right now. At the same time, we have Trump, you know, out there talking about we need to get interest rates down to 2% to be able to, you know, refinance the debt. And so, you know, you just have this push pull between what Trump wants. I think Trump's going to get what he wants. It's just a matter of when that happens. It is the big.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[56:15] Bright crypto macro indicator, the weekly global liquidity supply. So basically, if this number goes up, crypto goes up. And the higher this number goes, the higher presumably altcoins go as well. And so right now, global liquidity has recently, locally, dipped down. But the things to look for are what? like rate cuts from the Fed, big, beautiful bill, which adds to deficits. All of these things mean money printing, means global liquidity, number go up, means the crypto bull market continues. And those are the things to watch right now.
Michael Nadeau:
[56:54] That's it. I think so. This chart here is factoring in not just Fed liquidity, but all the major central banks. So the PBOC in China is actually a little bit more, has a little bit of a more loose policy right now, but we are also seeing like tightening in Europe and in the UK. So it's not just the US, they're involved as well. And I think that's it. Like once this turns, I think you will see a move for, for crypto and the longer tail. I think I may have put another chart in there is the last chart showing the Fed funds rate and ETH. Yeah. So along those lines, we've got ETH versus the Fed funds rate right here. And we can see that when that purple line, the Fed funds rate starts to come down, that's when the pink line goes up. And so you can even see last year when the Fed cut, I think it was 100 basis points. They did a full percentage point from September through December. You can see that and ETH went up, right? And then when they stopped cutting, ETH has gone down. And so if you see that purple line come down, most likely the pink line is going to go up and we're sort of in a holding pattern and we'll see how long we can hold on without a major sell-off, right? If liquidity conditions sort of really dry up.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[58:15] Look, man, I feel like with Trump's rhetoric with kind of the election cycle, actually, It's like, I mean, we're creeping on a year away. Politicians need to get reelected. I feel like it's a pretty fair bet that the purple line's coming down sometime soon. I mean, inflation's not running too hot from a CPI perspective.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[58:34] You know, all of these things, you know, blending together feels like a pretty good macro setup. So let me ask you the question I end these episodes with, which is, okay, what's in the portfolio now? What have you changed around? I think last time you were talking about long-term positions of Bitcoin and Ether. You also had some recent additions. You mentioned some of the blue chip memes like Pepe, WorldCoin. You have a position there. I assume you've got a position on Athena right now. What's in the portfolio?
Michael Nadeau:
[59:02] Yeah, so not a ton of changes. So 60% Bitcoin. Tend to be, that's like on the lower side for me. So I've been sort of allocating more into ETH, more into ETH related assets. So that's WorldCoin, that's Athena. We've been nibbling on these meme coins. So Pepe and Bonk are also in the portfolio. And I think we talked about last time we have a position in Celestia that we started buying under $3 that has been selling. So we're like underweight on that position right now. But I think that that is still like that. So we actually bought more of it at like a buck 30 recently. So sort of like, I would say more of a risk on posture, but still not like fully all in the markets. Like definitely keeping some cash on the sideline because I think there's a chance that liquidity conditions continue to sort of dry up and you get like another opportunity to buy even lower than we are now. So we'll see. I want to be in the market in case that doesn't happen, but also have some cash on the sideline in case there are more buying opportunities.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[1:00:10] That's great. And guys, we didn't get a chance to look at it. It's an exhaustive memo report in and of itself. But Mike also authored this great report. How do you value an L1 on the DeFi report, which you guys should absolutely read? If there's demand for an episode, we could do an episode on this, just this topic alone, because I think it's fascinating from a fundamentals perspective. And also, Mike, we've got something coming up, which is we're going to start doing quarterly reports together. And the DeFi report, you're planning to publish quarterly reports for, I believe, Ether and Sol starting in June or starting in July, right? So give us a feel for what's going to happen. Yeah.
Michael Nadeau:
[1:00:49] So we're going to roll these out. These will be the Q2 reports for this quarter. July 15th, we plan to publish these starting with ETH and Solana. And the plan here is, We want to produce a report that is sort of free of our opinion. It's just really the pure data and from the token holder perspective. And so that is what we're going to roll out later this mid-July. And then we're also going to pair this with our Dune dashboards. So we have all of the data that supports that report. And then we're going to do an earnings call where we sort of invite up leadership, right, from some of these communities. And like, we haven't seen this in crypto. And I think this will be interesting. I'm sure there'll be a mixed reaction to this on CT. But the idea is that like the token holders need a voice and they need to be able to sort of ask questions or understand things about how value accrues these tokens. What's the right way to be thinking about them in terms of in terms of valuation. And so we want analysts to have a place that they can come to sort of ask these types of questions. And we want the report to be free from our bias, our potential biases and just data driven and to let the market then interpret that on their own. We will do a separate podcast where I share my opinions about what the data is saying, but we want the market to be able to just take that and then build their own thesis, their own analysis on top of it. So super excited to work with you guys on that.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[1:02:15] I love it. Love the work you're doing. So you heard it here first.
Ryan Sean Adams:
[1:02:18] Earnings calls coming to crypto starting in July. Got to end with this. Of course, you know, none of this has been financial advice. Crypto is risky. You could lose what you put in, but we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the crypto fundamentals journey.

5. The Next Crypto Meta Is Loading
📖 Summary: 00:00:04:04 - 00:00:15:24
David
Welcome back to the station to the Friday weekly roll up. My co-host, Ryan Sean Adams is out for the week hanging out with his family. And we are tapping in Tom Schmidt from Dragonfly Inn to replace him. Tom. How are you doing, my man?
00:00:15:27 - 00:00:22:25
Tom
Good. Thanks for having me. I was just saying, this is like a nice, crossover app. But you came on the chopping block a couple weeks ago. Now I'm on bank.
00:00:22:25 - 00:00:28:23
David
List right now. You're right. Yeah, yeah. You know, the, the podcast. Just cycling through other podcasters. Eventually we'll have you.
00:00:28:23 - 00:00:29:21
Tom
All right.
00:00:29:24 - 00:00:53:16
David
Yeah, I see everyone should just get into one big podcast and we'll have one room and see how it goes. Overall, before we get into the news of the week, which was a pretty light week, I'll call it. We have the call. She raise. We have some markets to talk about. Nothing too big this week. So in order to kind of kick things off of kind of get your vibe, check, about the state of crypto because we are going from one half of the year to the other.
00:00:53:16 - 00:01:12:09
David
It is June 26th at the time of recording, so we're finishing the first half. And during the second half of the year, I remember general sentiment. I don't know what your market take was going into this year, but general consensus was rough first half of the year for the second half of the year. And I think that that has played out more or less to a tee.
00:01:12:09 - 00:01:13:13
David
Wondering what your take is.
00:01:13:17 - 00:01:34:00
Tom
Yeah. I, I feel like whenever there's some macro chaos, some geopolitical chaos, then it's always taking the driver's seat and crypto is always sort of, secondary and feels like, you know, this week we were kind of covering from a lot of the geopolitical craziness from the past couple weeks. Yeah. It's been quiet. I think, permissionless was taking place in New York.
00:01:34:04 - 00:01:50:08
Tom
A lot of people in town talking about that. But also there's a lot of focus on equities. And I feel like you know, we'll talk a little bit about that, which has been kind of bizarre. It feels like a very much a reversal of like 2020 when crypto was going crazy. And just equities market. Everyone's like looking and there's nothing nothing really going on.
00:01:50:11 - 00:02:09:24
David
Yeah. Yeah. Zooming in on the Bitcoin price. We are up 3% on the week to 107,500 and ETH prices down 3% on the week. So a little bit a little bit of divergence between the two majors. But overall Bitcoin I guess if we zoom out to the three month mark, we're up a pretty substantial amount coming out, up from $80,000 to almost $110,000.
00:02:09:24 - 00:02:24:19
David
We did hit that $111,000 in May. So we are kind of ranging between the 110, 100 and thousand dollars. Are you bullish? Are you like eagerly awaiting the breakthrough of new all time highs or are you more patient?
00:02:24:21 - 00:02:45:28
Tom
How come you mean how can you not be bullish like every week? I heard you read a headline that would have been totally unbelievable, five years ago, let alone ten years ago. Interest in terms of interest, traction, adoption in the space even now. I mean, we, you know, bemoan. Oh, Bitcoin's down $200,000. Kind of insane.
00:02:46:00 - 00:02:56:15
Tom
There's actually, like, a tweet from 2020, maybe 2018, even joking about this fact that, like, hey, in five years, we'll be complaining about Bitcoin dropping two $90,000 a year. And then here we are. Yeah.
00:02:56:20 - 00:03:06:22
David
Now I don't want to pin you down to anything specific because I know that's just not how markets work. But I'm generally feeling that you are in the camp of Bitcoin is currently edging. And we are looking through an all time. We're looking for an all time high.
00:03:06:25 - 00:03:27:16
Tom
Yeah, I think really the only thing that's going to stop this is some sort of bigger shift in yeah, monetary policy, some big again, macro calamity. Maybe we get, you know, dollar strengthening later half the year. That could be really bad for the market, though. Right now it feels like, there's really only tailwinds.
00:03:27:18 - 00:03:30:27
Tom
And so I really know what's going to kind of make us deviate from this path.
00:03:30:29 - 00:03:53:01
David
Yeah, yeah. The total crypto market cap coming in at $3.4 trillion. So that's actually pretty still far away from its peak at 3.9 trillion. So like $300 billion off. But nonetheless, the Bitcoin dominance story I feel like is the the news of the week, at least in terms of the crypto markets side of things, because we are just hitting new all time high, new all time high week after week.
00:03:53:01 - 00:04:15:22
David
There's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, maybe eight, depending on how good my counting is. Weeks straight of green candles on Bitcoin dominance to a high that we have not yet seen since all the way back in December of 2020. So Bitcoin dominance is at 66%. When you see this, what do you think?
00:04:15:25 - 00:04:39:16
Tom
That's where I would have, pegged it more for like a 2019 alternative I guess 2020 there is I'll say I can I mean, I guess it goes back to this, the stat being very sick. Whenever it's over, you need to prepare yourself to be back and, and vice versa. And I think right now it's any time there's grave dancing, which is kind of what you see, I think from, from, from Maxis on the, on the rest of the space, in my mind, that just means there's more opportunity and it looks different every time.
00:04:39:19 - 00:04:55:22
Tom
I mean, even the market now looks different than 2021 and looks different than 2017, but there is going to be a shift. And I think things don't move kind of monotonically like that. So you and I did that a year from now, I think Bitcoin dominance will be lower, but I don't know what the rest of the market's going to look like.
00:04:55:24 - 00:05:15:18
David
Yeah. A year from now I totally agree. And from a for an entire year I think you could still slowly see this thing grind up. It's at 66%. It could go to 75%. And there's nothing stopping it. And that grave dancing can just get louder from the bitcoin. Eyes can just get louder and louder and louder, and it'll be more annoying and people will capitulate even more.
00:05:15:21 - 00:05:22:22
David
But when Bitcoin dominance does turn over, it has never gone down slowly. It only goes down very, very fast.
00:05:22:24 - 00:05:41:15
Tom
Yes. I think that that's right. I mean, there's always I feel like there's sort of some new meta which is ultimately going to drive down Bitcoin dominance. And when there's a meta that's the frostiness that we were kind of talking about. And so, yeah, I'm curious to see what that looks like. Again. Different every time. But it feels like there's, there's little green shoots popping up here and there.
00:05:41:18 - 00:06:08:03
David
Yeah, yeah. That new meta that you talked about it I'm going to call it a token issuance meta. The ICO mania in 2017 was what brought Bitcoin dominance down from, the high high number of 96% down to the lowest it's ever been at 34%. That was the ICO meta. The NFT mania in 2021 also brought it down, where it crept back up in that bear market, up to 72% and brought it down to 40%.
00:06:08:11 - 00:06:28:29
David
And then actually, interestingly, the meme coin mania only really like I'll call the peak of the meme coin mania starting in November of 2024, right before Donald Trump issued the Trump token. And with the issuance of the Trump token, the Bitcoin dominance went from 61% down to 55%. So the meme coin mania did not really make a dent in overall Bitcoin dominance.
00:06:28:29 - 00:06:33:01
David
So that was not really the cycle that we were looking for.
00:06:33:03 - 00:06:52:15
Tom
Yeah. I mean I think that is true, which is people always I remember when, when meme coins were going big people talk about, oh, this is just, everyone being tired of, of VC coins, people being tired of Bitcoin and to spike like. Yeah. But in in absolute terms, these are, you know, pretty small numbers.
00:06:52:15 - 00:07:06:27
Tom
Right. This is kind of a weird little pocket of the industry. I think the NFT thing was, was interesting where like again, that would not have been something I think you would have predicted in 2019 that like, yeah, anything to make a big Dan. Yeah, they did. And who knows maybe something, you know, will make that happen this time around.
00:07:06:27 - 00:07:11:21
Tom
Maybe, you know, tokenized equity use or maybe perps will be they could take a big dig in it.
00:07:11:23 - 00:07:32:09
David
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. In 2019, I remember, me, Ryan, a lot of the Ethereum crowd of people were just so bullish on DeFi and things like MakerDAO and Uniswap. And we're going to democratize finance. And you know, we got we got that bull market. That was DeFi Summer that did not make a dent in Bitcoin dominance. It was the NFT mania that made a dent in Bitcoin dominance.
00:07:32:09 - 00:07:55:03
David
And that brought in the net new people. And then we were like, you look at our cool new financial toys and they're like, I want to collect the monkey jpeg. And we just we had just no ability at all to predict that, that coming our way at all. And so I'm guessing whatever, whatever brings Bitcoin dominance from 70% back down to like 45% or wherever it goes is going to be something that like, no one actually sees coming.
00:07:55:06 - 00:07:59:22
Tom
Yeah. I mean, it could be, you know, ICOs coming back and we're kind of seen again like sign.
00:07:59:22 - 00:08:00:02
David
It into the.
00:08:00:03 - 00:08:06:16
Tom
Future that. Yeah. You know, I don't think it's the, the worst idea in the shape of like capital formation.
00:08:06:18 - 00:08:11:12
David
Well, you see you're an ICO meta fan. Maybe you can talk about why why you like ICOs.
00:08:11:14 - 00:08:37:14
Tom
I don't know, I would say I'm a fan, but I don't hate it. I think, hopefully we've kind of learned some of the lessons from the 2017 ICO phase, and I think there has been maybe just an exhaustion, I think, of market participants. And that's where I think a lot of the infighting and Twitter finger pointing is happening where, you know, traders and retail investors blame DC and VCs blame projects and products from VCs again to I don't remember, mean something really healthy.
00:08:37:16 - 00:08:59:12
Tom
Yeah. But, you know, it's okay. This is a byproduct of the current state of of fundraising and capital formation. Then there's there's appetite, I think, for more early stage interest also, frankly, the way projects are raising capital is just so much different than it was, you know, five years ago where, early stage teams need less capital.
00:08:59:12 - 00:09:19:08
Tom
They're doing fewer private rounds. You can see that all kind of collapsing at some point where, hey, maybe we don't do a private market, or maybe we do one small private round and then a public sale, and that's kind of it. And I think that has been kind of the only maybe major trend line I've seen in, in private fundraising has been, hey, maybe we don't need, you know, $200 million to make a new blockchain.
00:09:19:10 - 00:09:27:06
Tom
Maybe we need a lot less and a lot less time, and we can kind of, you know, compress, our capital needs, and therefore open up to the public.
00:09:27:09 - 00:09:53:29
David
Yeah, yeah. There was an era, maybe two years ago, three years ago, where the $1 billion raise or the monster raise was truly a signal for retail investors. And now, I think in more recent times, that has flipped on its head, where the very large, gargantuan raise has turned into anti signal, whereas like, oh, this this is like, I'm not going to name any VCs, but there are there's a select cohort of VCs out there that I think are being branded by these as these like token shops.
00:09:54:01 - 00:10:19:03
David
And they do these very large high valuation raises. And like it's just early in the lifespan of said company. And so this is said company is brand new. Getting $1 billion valuation from like the same kind of cohort of VCs. And people are just like flagging that. And that is not is the opposite of what the signal it used to be like 2 or 3 years ago, which like I think, I think is is good is is a pendulum shift.
00:10:19:06 - 00:10:37:16
David
And I think, you know, the it can shift too far. I think as well it can get too toxic. It can be too, too much of like a, too much of a good thing. But that is kind of like, what the current meta is, is like the large VC race is kind of being, thrown up by, by the market, at least the Twitter discourse, I'll say.
00:10:37:18 - 00:10:54:24
Tom
Yeah, I think that's a good way of, of phrasing it. I think obviously this is, in my mind, provide value beyond just the capital in a sense. What I know, like delighted to myself and I think your project products, do you say that about about good VCs? I think there's also a lot of angst around the exchange listing.
00:10:54:24 - 00:11:12:18
Tom
Meta. A large chunk of the, projects going to, exchanges. And, hey, maybe these aren't as positive signal as they used to be. Not everything's going to pump on a by insisting anymore. And so I think that all kind of creates, this discontent that creates revolution. And I think that's what you're seeing right now.
00:11:12:22 - 00:11:33:03
David
Yeah, yeah. The other thing that's happening alongside of that is I can remember what, Echo Round it was or maybe it was the token sale on, on sonar on the new platform. And then like a bunch of, you know, retail investors got access to be able to invest in this thing for the first time. And it was like, very clearly a lot of people's first exposure to VC investing.
00:11:33:05 - 00:11:51:29
David
And, I can't remember what the tweet, but there was like the realization that, oh, this is actually very likely not going to work. And that is the game that VCs have always been doing. And retail things that, like VCs just have this like staircase to Heaven, where every single project you know is a ten x 100 x every single time.
00:11:52:04 - 00:12:10:14
David
But in reality, like, the odds are much slimmer in just retail, haven't they just not exposed to the failures? And now, like Kobe's ICO platform is exposing, like the actual failure rate of venture startups to retail investors and that's a that's a new experience for many in the in the retail side of things.
00:12:10:16 - 00:12:34:21
Tom
Yeah. I think, you know, there's a phenomenon adventure where you want sort of professional LPs who are institutional. You do a lot of venture, who write chunky checks and sort of can, can weather the storm. And it's kind of seen it all and can be extremely annoying when things go well or things go poorly. And I think prior to that same phenomenon where, if things go poorly, like you actually kind of want a VC, backing you who's seen it all and can kind of help you and right isn't going complaining.
00:12:34:21 - 00:12:45:04
Tom
Whereas yes, I think retail can kind of, feel like I mean, it's going to I mean, certainly the median venture fund does not do particularly well. But, you know, the outliers obviously make up for the rest of it.
00:12:45:07 - 00:13:06:23
David
Yeah. Let's turn our attention to the meme coin markets. Excuse me, the trad fi markets where we're looking at the circle price, it's actually come down from the all time highs that it set just last week of 297 ridiculous dollars. It is still ridiculous price of $210. So we had a decline in the circle price. Any any commentary on on the circle price action post IPO?
00:13:06:26 - 00:13:24:25
Tom
I think this is like the most mispriced IPO I've seen in maybe my entire career. I mean, I can't imagine another I can't remember the last time an IPO in pump ten, after listing and the bizarre thing was like they were trying to IPO for the longest time. They were shopping this thing around. No one wanted to buy it.
00:13:24:27 - 00:13:39:21
Tom
And maybe they're just showing the wrong people. I don't actually know who's buying circle stock. I think Robert Leshner suspected sort of TikTok retail traders, which might be true, but it's it's it's he he claims he's seeing, TikToks of, people telling others to buy circles.
00:13:39:21 - 00:13:42:12
David
Like I cannot imagine Robert Leshner is scrolling TikTok.
00:13:42:14 - 00:14:06:13
Tom
I can't either. And he claims, oh, the best TikToks make it onto Twitter. And I'm like, you can just say you have a TikTok account, Robert. Like, it's okay. Yeah, it's it's a big app. But it does seem like there's a weird disconnect between this thing was such a dog in the private markets to now being such a public market darling, and now everyone is taking note and everyone's like, oh, maybe I should go public, or maybe I should, you know, you know, do something in stablecoin land.
00:14:06:13 - 00:14:10:22
Tom
And so it's sort of like the signals are, are, you know, percolating to the rest of the market.
00:14:10:24 - 00:14:33:05
David
Okay. So this might be Cooper. But when people say this is a mispriced ICO and everyone's like, oh, I totally mid curve that I should have bought it on open. It's obviously everyone is saying that in hindsight hindsight 2020. But we understand the circle of fundamentals. And like with that the $31 IPO price aligns with that. It was it's like $150 million of yearly income.
00:14:33:05 - 00:14:33:24
David
It's not not.
00:14:33:24 - 00:14:34:25
Tom
Great.
00:14:34:27 - 00:14:57:08
David
$31 billion. There is already like a me a stablecoin premium baked into a company that has $150 million of yearly revenue, being price at $7 billion. There's already a premium there. So, like in the sense when you say that it is mispriced, that is just objectively true in the sense that we can now look at the price of $300 out of here and just say that that is what is true.
00:14:57:08 - 00:15:07:09
David
But I also, again, I preface this saying, this might be Coke, but like, I don't know, I feel like it's justified at $31 and it's just not justified at 210.
00:15:07:11 - 00:15:27:00
Tom
I don't disagree. I would not have bought it, I don't know, but I didn't buy it. Okay, I didn't really I thought I was, was crazy. I but you know, I think the market you have to take signals in the market and the market is telling you something else. And maybe these people are totally irrational or maybe of a different view than I do, but, I think, as always, you know, markets are forward looking.
00:15:27:00 - 00:15:48:14
Tom
And I think when people look at circle, they see, hey, we have guys act passing the Senate, all these big, fintechs, all these big 4500. It's getting in a stablecoins circle is clearly in the lead, when it comes to sort of regulated, you know, stablecoin issuer in the US, and it's there's really not many other ways to express that view.
00:15:48:17 - 00:15:53:15
Tom
In the equity markets. I mean, there was a bit of a catch up trading in coins. People really.
00:15:53:17 - 00:15:54:15
David
Pulled out up here.
00:15:54:18 - 00:16:00:04
Tom
Revenue. But other than that, like, what else are you going to buy? And I think that that's a large part of the rally, too.
00:16:00:07 - 00:16:20:02
David
Yeah. This was the circle price pump was just a very isolated rally. Why not go in from like it opened up at 30, immediately jump to 70 and then just climb to 130 and no other crypto equity mainly Coinbase was really moving at all. Coinbase actually kind of traded down even, that has changed in the last just four days.
00:16:20:02 - 00:16:41:22
David
Coin stock has gone from $254 to $375, in about nine days. So that's a 50% increase in the last nine days. So coin is doing a catch up trade. I would say like there is a correlation to circle here. I feel pretty confident in making that market call that it was because of the circle price where people are like, all right, circle so goddamn frothy, like, where else can we get exposure?
00:16:41:22 - 00:17:02:01
David
Oh, let's buy the company that has 50% of circle's revenues. And so, like my commentary before this was, okay, there's a lot of private companies that are looking to go public downstream of the circle. Very positive IPO and then trading price action afterwards. Like as soon as something is right after IPO that's very signal. Big signal that the public markets are ready.
00:17:02:01 - 00:17:19:03
David
So like now people are like looking at Kraken and looking at, Chainalysis of all things Fireblocks, all these private companies that could, in theory, IPO and they're like, okay, like that's the next one. There's going to be a next one. But when people were making these comments, I was like, look at the coin stock, look at the coin price.
00:17:19:03 - 00:17:44:26
David
It's not going anywhere. It's actually just a stable coin narrative. It's just about stablecoins. But that is now wrong over the last nine days, because the coin price has hit new all time highs. And so if we zoom out all the way to the Pico top of the 2021 bull market, when coin launched at like 375, I guess it did trade briefly higher up to 420, but it launched at 320 $75.
00:17:44:29 - 00:18:00:08
David
We are at $375 right now, so we are matching one for one the price that coin listed out at the top of the 2021 market. I think that ended the bull market. And now we are back here. Give me some commentary on just like the long term price action that you see in coin.
00:18:00:10 - 00:18:21:04
Tom
Yeah. I mean, I think you're right that again, the credit markets take signal from the public markets, they see is doing well as coin doing well. And now you see all these sort of, longer tail companies now looking to IPO kind of based on comps, right. They're saying, well, hey, if they can get this kind of price with this kind of multiple, maybe we can also get something pretty favorable.
00:18:21:07 - 00:18:39:00
Tom
We'll see. I think Coinbase has been kind of a strange, company on Wall Street where some people look at it and it's just a total dog. And they're like this thing. I remember even the narrative in 2019 was initiated away from exchange revenues, and there's going to be fee compression. And they need to be more of like a bank.
00:18:39:02 - 00:19:00:01
Tom
And then that was like just totally obliterated, right? In like 2020, 2021 was like, oh yeah, maybe if there is no fee compression, maybe they have some sort of, remnote. Maybe they'll change this time around. I do think, you know, certainly. Some of the other trading platforms return that the ETF launch. You could argue that cannibalistic to, some of the revenues, but it's also SMEs strong tailwinds behind it.
00:19:00:03 - 00:19:14:20
Tom
I don't know if I, I'm going to, jump the boat here. Jump the gun here a little bit on on Robinhood. But that's been the other kind of crazy all time high moves. Europe over the past few weeks has been. And, you know, was it like 30, 40% of their revenue is also coming from from crypto.
00:19:14:20 - 00:19:15:07
Tom
So like.
00:19:15:07 - 00:19:16:21
David
Oh, really? I didn't notice that much.
00:19:16:25 - 00:19:35:07
Tom
Yeah. If you look at their last, earnings report. Yeah it's very, very heavily crypto. And it's a very weird segment of crypto. Like I think they're number one or number two asset was like Doge. And and so it's just, just a totally different type of user than probably users trading on, on, on Coinbase or, you know, trading on Uniswap.
00:19:35:07 - 00:19:44:16
Tom
And so, you know, but yeah, again, if you think about them as like a crypto data play, I think that that's probably, another, you know, sort of attractive position.
00:19:44:19 - 00:20:04:10
David
Yeah. Yeah. Are you saying okay, so the recent price action in hood is just phenomenal. They also, like you say, got obliterated throughout like post. When they were, interest rates started going higher and higher and higher and 22 and they also, hood, Robin hood launched also in 2021, in August of 2021. So pretty similar to Coinbase timing actually.
00:20:04:13 - 00:20:26:06
David
And then, you know, launch at $60 and just got obliterated, went down below $10 for a very long time, something like two years. It stayed below $10. And then just in, let's see, when was it about the start of 2024. It was $10 and it started creeping upwards to where it is now at $83. How much do you credit crypto as a part of this price increase?
00:20:26:06 - 00:20:36:27
David
You think the the all time high that hood is seeing and continually breaking on a week over week basis? Is that downstream of crypto or is that more of. It's just like regular business. Do you think?
00:20:36:29 - 00:21:05:23
Tom
Hard to say. I mean, again, as a percentage is quite high. So if you think of, hey like that being a driving force, then, you know, I think it's like a, certainly a big part of it. I don't think weirdly, that's been a big part of running its public story. Like if you think of all their new product announcements, it's actually been about trying to take their existing user base and upsell them and convert them and turn them into this more sort of long term financial plan, which planner which has been or, you know, asset managers have been kind of their whole story the whole time where it's like, hey, you, you
00:21:05:23 - 00:21:26:24
Tom
come for the meme stock trading and you stay for that for a week. And the, you know, I think it's honestly, yeah, it's definitely been a good move on their part. Interestingly, I saw some research recently that, a lot of the Zoomers and the alphas are not actually getting on the Robinhood. It's like they kind of captured this, like, millennial cohort that I feel like I'm a part of.
00:21:26:27 - 00:21:40:20
Tom
And they're aging with the platform. They're staying in Robinhood, but the Youngs are not actually onboarding. And so that you maybe it's okay. Maybe you're getting people as a kind of agent of their peak earning years. But, kind of, maybe a bit counter to kind of the public narrative for them.
00:21:40:20 - 00:21:56:19
David
Yeah. That is counter to my understanding. I mean, I guess I could account for that in a couple reasons. Maybe Zoomers just don't have that money. That much money yet. Maybe they're just not in not investing because I can't imagine where they would go. I don't see them opening up a TD, TD Ameritrade or any other sort of trad brokerage.
00:21:56:19 - 00:22:01:14
David
So if they're not going to Robinhood, I kind of think they're my gut take is that they're not doing anything.
00:22:01:16 - 00:22:07:13
Tom
Yeah, that's certainly possible. Maybe they're going on chain. Maybe they're you know, I don't know, trading.
00:22:07:15 - 00:22:08:07
David
TikTok for.
00:22:08:07 - 00:22:31:25
Tom
Coins. Yeah, whatever. I just pull up their, Q1 earnings. So in, Q1 2025 or 2025, Robinhood made 22. Nil gross on on cryptocurrencies out of nine, 27 nil gross for that quarter. So pretty substantial. I mean, they made as they did more in crypto than they did on options. And it five times more than they made on equities.
00:22:31:25 - 00:22:35:02
Tom
And so yeah it's it's a big part of the business.
00:22:35:04 - 00:22:53:03
David
They have a pretty big announcement at SEC. And can is that is going on Monday. I'm going to that event. So actually they already gave you the embargo. It's very large. Announcement is pretty cool. I'm pretty stoked for it. So basically say you guys will see that in your podcast feed on Tuesday of next week.
00:22:53:03 - 00:23:10:24
David
So, stay, hold your breath for that one last thing before we move on. I don't know if you pay attention to this as much as I do or other people in industry, but I growing number of people keep on showing me this good coin ratio. So yeah, we got the bitcoin ether ratio. But now we also have the hood coin ratio.
00:23:11:00 - 00:23:31:15
David
So like there is also similarly similarly valued. I don't know if this is the price. Yeah. This is the price over price not valuation or valuation. But the valuation is both around roughly $75 billion. So people are in this like horse race between Coinbase and Hood. I don't know if you have an affiliation here, Tom, that you would like to share.
00:23:31:17 - 00:23:49:05
Tom
I do not have an affiliation. I guess I, I don't know either individually or then maybe through an index fund or something. I, I don't know, I, I actually would be impressed, frankly, with, with Robinhood's product execution. I think when you get to a company of a certain age, there's a natural tendency to kind of fall off.
00:23:49:05 - 00:24:01:14
Tom
And, I do think keep shipping fresh new products. I mean, even I either prediction market stuff, for the election and some of the newer stuff they've been doing, I mean, just just cutting edge for, you know, kind of a brokerage of their age. All right.
00:24:01:14 - 00:24:16:02
David
We're going to get into the rest of the news of the week, starting with, call she's raise, they raise a bunch of money. And Tom, I think, had the tweet of the week that we are going to talk about. I won't spoil that, but I thought it was pretty good. And then we're going to get into how you can get a mortgage with your crypto.
00:24:16:05 - 00:24:48:22
David
So we're going to get to all of that and more. But first, a message from some of these fantastic sponsors that makes this show possible. Call the prediction market. Market. The poly market competitor announced their $185 million raise, their series C raise, which values Kelsey at $2 billion. This raise is round, even though to my understanding, I don't think she has anything to do with crypto, this was nonetheless invested in by a bunch of crypto VCs, including paradigm multi Coin, and then also some people outside of crypto like Sequoia and some other VC firms that I am not familiar with.
00:24:48:22 - 00:25:08:19
David
So this has just kind of rocketed around the trad media world because you have the non crypto prediction market. I think fitting in with the non crypto media organizations. And so I think you're kind of seeing like a bifurcation of the internet and people are picking allegiances here. Everything is getting tribal these days. Like I alluded to Tommy you have a spicy tweet.
00:25:08:19 - 00:25:28:08
David
I don't want to get to that yet. I first want to kind of just get your take on a $2 billion valuation of a prediction market. I think everyone in crypto is generally bullish on prediction markets, because that's kind of like our technology. And so that feels like our turf. And we have this non crypto startup raising at a $2 billion valuation.
00:25:28:08 - 00:25:33:23
David
What do you overall what do you think about a $2 billion prediction market.
00:25:33:26 - 00:25:53:02
Tom
I don't think anything crazy about $2 billion for a prediction market. I think 2 billion for Khaleesi is a little nuts in my mind. I mean, you can see some of the metrics, not particularly impressive in my mind. I think they also obviously faces competition issue two I mentioned with with Robert Head. And suddenly this partnership with Robert had a do distribution.
00:25:53:04 - 00:26:12:03
Tom
And that's, you know, pretty, pretty attractive in terms of fees. But you just this platform risk. And there's also the forecast X, which is another, you know, CME events. Platform that Robinhood used for the election. Actually they didn't use Kelce. And yeah, again, they they're the one who ultimately has the end relationship with the user.
00:26:12:06 - 00:26:36:29
Tom
And he polymer considered a really good job of going direct to user having their own brand. I mean Shane post their you know, visitor numbers. And you know that they're putting up the same, order of magnitude of visitor numbers, as you know, some of the biggest, sites in the space. But, I just don't I don't really see that sort of affinity with Kelce early as he paid tweets from, influencers versus actual, organic interest.
00:26:36:29 - 00:26:40:19
Tom
But full disclosure, dragonfly is also an investor in Poly Market.
00:26:40:22 - 00:27:01:28
David
Okay. Okay. All right. One last question before we get into the tribal side of things. What were they? There are what do you think about the crypto companies investing in a non crypto? Sorry, there's no actual firm like rules like crypto VCs can't invest in non crypto projects. There's no there's no rules about that. But nonetheless it's interesting to me that we have some crypto VCs investing in poly markets.
00:27:01:28 - 00:27:04:04
David
Competitor. What's your gut take about that.
00:27:04:06 - 00:27:20:04
Tom
Yeah I I mean I do maybe Kelce has some deeper features in the product roadmap that I'm not privy to. They do I did or they did recently start to accept stablecoins I believe. So maybe they see some of the opportunity in kind of the, you know, design trading going on in crypto land and want some of it.
00:27:20:04 - 00:27:42:09
Tom
But they still missed out on the core component. And I think that's something that does not get brought up enough, which is Poly Market is actually happening on chain. I mean, you can't edit it using this order book, but like the trades settle on chain, you can see the balances, you can see the trades. It's verifiable that, you know, they're using, for the Oracle, like, it's very cool and transparent and embodies so much of, you know, the DeFi story where Kelsey has, you know, none of that.
00:27:42:09 - 00:27:47:10
Tom
It's it's really just an exchange that can take your stablecoins, if you if you want to send it to them.
00:27:47:10 - 00:28:07:25
David
Yeah. I mean, the main difference between Kashi and Poly Market, of course, is that call sheet is legal for United States citizens and entities, and Poly Market is not, and so they're just like an off shore predictions market, right. And so, you know, in theory, it's possible to open up a VPN. I'm not recommending that, but that's technically possible if you're unsure.
00:28:07:27 - 00:28:26:25
David
But to me, it's maybe there's like a parallel here between like, circle and tether, where circle is off shore and has more freedoms and, excuse me, tether is offshore, it has more freedom. Circle is onshore and has more restrictions, but you get to have onshore customers. I feel like that's a fair comparison. What's your what's your reaction?
00:28:26:28 - 00:28:46:13
Tom
Yeah, I actually like that. I mean, I was going to say, I think, you know, maybe the comp was going to be, good versus Coinbase, but, I like the tether circle comparison a little bit more. I do think, you know, people under index on the amount of, prediction market interest coming from outside the US.
00:28:46:13 - 00:29:04:24
Tom
I mean, there's, you know, for the longest time, Ladbrokes was like the largest, prediction market for the US election, which is a UK based, sports betting, site. And so there is, you know, it is the biggest election in the, in the, in the world. And I think, that they're also just more and more events that people want to trade on me.
00:29:05:00 - 00:29:10:10
Tom
The New York mayoral election, Israel, Iran, it just kind of the way people consume news now.
00:29:10:13 - 00:29:28:27
David
Okay. Tom, I would like to get into the spicy side of things. So you have, freedom to take the take the muzzle off. This is a tweet that you tweeted out, with some screenshots saying, never forget that, Carl. She is a team of little rats. And there are some stories here that this one came out of, pirate wires with the title of, call.
00:29:28:27 - 00:29:54:03
David
She paid influencers to target Poly Market CEO after a FBI raid. And then there are some other screenshots that I have. I believe somebody from poly Market, in DMs with a influencer who has a bunch of followers, to retweet the tweet of, CEO Shane Kaplan of Poly Market getting raided by the FBI right before the, the Trump Biden election.
00:29:54:03 - 00:30:16:06
David
So maybe, listeners might remember that, that, the, the CEO of Poly Market, Shane, got raided. I think to this day, no one really knows why. And we have verified screenshots of somebody from the Koski team convincing a general influencer on Twitter to retweet the tweet, saying, yo, this guy looks guilty, which, is, unfortunate behavior.
00:30:16:06 - 00:30:24:09
David
I would I would call that. And so that leads Tom here, to call the call team a bunch of a bunch of rats. Was. Tell me how you really feel, Tom.
00:30:24:11 - 00:30:58:26
Tom
Yeah. Look, I'm, I'm all in favor of healthy product competition. I would say, you know, this is just kind of the public story that's available on you. There's a bunch of stuff below, you know, the tip of the iceberg that maybe not don't want to discuss on this podcast, but, yeah, I think, I, I mean, frankly, I just don't think they really in behaving as good actors in the space, this is, again, one story that might come out, in, in public, but I don't think it's okay to like, you know, basically libel your competitors, or to, you're trying to beat them on things that aren't just
00:30:58:26 - 00:31:15:09
Tom
product. And so, I think on the flip side, Shane's been like an unbelievable builder. He's been building a poly market for, you know, over five years, six years, even during their marketing, there's no volume. And he built it in a way that I think, again, embodies, the spirit of crypto in the spirit of DeFi and what we're trying to do.
00:31:15:09 - 00:31:32:04
Tom
I think there's many ways to take a shortcut. And instead he, you know, I mean, if you look at the contracts, literally, it's like derived from the Gnosis prediction market, you know, way back in like 2017. And so, there's kind of this nice through line here. And, I think it's also just incredible utility for it.
00:31:32:04 - 00:31:53:23
Tom
The world. It's it's crazy to me now that, like so many world events, you know, we previously relied on pundits to give us our news and, Yeah. And they were wrong. And I think we kind of saw this with mean, most recently New York mayoral election, that, you know, this is just a way better, better incentive aligned version of how people get news now.
00:31:53:23 - 00:32:07:13
Tom
And so, I'm very properly market. And again, I just don't I yeah, I don't want to get too, too much into it, but, I think we need to kind of let you know, do some self-policing as an industry and, you know, weed out the bad actors.
00:32:07:13 - 00:32:31:03
David
Yeah, yeah, yeah. For those that don't remember, I remember, Carl, she was operating in this very limited capacity because they were under a lawsuit from the CFTC. That was really restricting their ability to just, like, operate at a startup at all. And then that they won that lawsuit or something like this, and then that when that restriction went away and they were finally open, able to open their doors like not too long before the U.S. election.
00:32:31:06 - 00:32:47:25
David
And so they really advertise themselves as, like, the only legal place for United States citizens to get into a bet on the outcome of the the United States election. But they were just so late to the game because Poly Market had already more or less like started to really crescendo in volumes, ahead of the US election.
00:32:47:25 - 00:33:04:09
David
So they were just very clearly coming from behind. And like, I like my first impressions of them was like, I mean, I kind of feel bad for them because the CFTC was really like not letting them off the leash. And they were really hamstrung by the fact that Poly Market was able to operate because they were targeting an international, international client base.
00:33:04:16 - 00:33:21:11
David
And then so they had to do some like kind of like kind of mean tweets, pointing at Poly Market. And I was like, okay, but I get it. They're an underdog. They need to like, clamor for relevancy. And so I remember some of these mean tweets from the Carlucci team going out, like trying to to fight for relevancy.
00:33:21:17 - 00:33:43:17
David
And I was like, okay, you know what? Like I get it. Like they kind of need it. But then the the, the the distasteful ness also crescendo as well. And they've kind of never really lost that. It's like more than worse in Scrappiness. It's like kind of just like actual, yeah, this distasteful ness growing out of the call sheet side of things.
00:33:43:17 - 00:33:48:01
David
That's my that's my account of history. And again, I won't ask you to comment anymore unless you unless you're unless you have something to say.
00:33:48:03 - 00:34:05:12
Tom
I think a good litmus is, if there's anything that you're doing that you wouldn't want to kind of in discovery or. Yeah, yeah. For everyone to see, I probably shouldn't be doing it. And then there's a lot of things going on at KLC that probably are in this bucket. So again, trying to send a mean tweet, find you, you know, it could be an, product, but, yeah, I.
00:34:05:13 - 00:34:21:17
David
Didn't I didn't exactly start for the mean tweets. It just only got got worse from there. Yeah, yeah. And then. Yeah. And I've also just heard rumors of Kelce just operating very nefariously under the table. But nothing I can actually like substantiate. So all right let's get into I think the crypto Twitter's favorite news of the week.
00:34:21:17 - 00:34:43:01
David
This came out of the US director of federal housing. So he's an appointee by Donald Trump, I believe, who tweeted out after significant studying and keeping with Trump's vision to make the United States the crypto capital of the world. Today, I ordered the great Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prepare their businesses to count cryptocurrency as an asset for a mortgage.
00:34:43:04 - 00:35:02:29
David
And so this is, this individual who is ahead of the matters that are relevant for this to get the, the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are in kind of this, like pseudo private, public operated, companies that, do more I can't really remember. I'm losing my own history, but they just manage the mortgage standards in the United States.
00:35:03:01 - 00:35:28:23
David
And they started to get heavily regulated post, oh eight crisis. And so they are being ordered to look into the possibility of allowing crypto assets to be lever like, leveraged as like valid liquid assets for people's mortgages. So the memes on on crypto Twitter, of course, just went straight into, the The Big Short movie where people are looking at the I can't remember the individual who called the Big Short.
00:35:28:25 - 00:35:31:22
David
But the we have mortgages. What was the name?
00:35:31:24 - 00:35:32:14
Tom
Michael Berry.
00:35:32:14 - 00:35:53:13
David
Michael berry, thank you. Michael Berry. Realizing that there's a ton of mortgages in America that are totally collateralized with fart coin and XRP 69,000, which of course is not in the actual order, but there was no general specific cryptocurrency that was labeled, just like crypto can now be assets for mortgages. Tom, when you saw this news, what was your reaction?
00:35:53:15 - 00:36:28:19
Tom
Yeah. I mean, maybe, maybe two initial reactions. One, it maybe, verify this because this is what I remember, when the, bitcoin and ether ETFs launched their Dtcc and the Depository Trust and Clearing Commission marked both of those ETFs with 100% haircut for for collateral in U.S brokerages, meaning you can't actually borrow against these ETFs the same way you can for, an S&P ETF or any, any frankly, any sort of equity or bond or anything else you would hold in your brokerage that these basically count as zero, for collateral.
00:36:28:22 - 00:36:40:07
Tom
And that hasn't changed. And so it would be extremely bizarre to me if you can count your crypto assets as collateral for your mortgage, but you can't, can your crypto ETFs as as collateral? Free for your margin loan, which is feel.
00:36:40:07 - 00:36:52:00
David
Like you, if anything, if you were taking them more like, marginal steps forward, the ETFs would be the only thing that would be valid. And even crypto on chain crypto would be considered not valid.
00:36:52:03 - 00:37:14:13
Tom
You would think so. And they could do it with, you know, the stroke of a pen, right? You just change the haircut and instead they haven't. And so I would love to see that change. Right. I mean, this goes with all these sort of weird accounting rules. Remember when, there's a sec, staff bulletin around, you know, to count crypto assets, as assets on your, on your balance sheet, but it can only be liabilities which stopped all these banks.
00:37:14:13 - 00:37:32:25
Tom
And so I think there's a lot of weird plumbing and digital finance, ecosystem that still is kind of keeping crypto back in some ways. And this being one of those, and two, I mean, there are a number of startups that have kind of position that themselves. As you know, we are the, the mortgage lending platform that accepts crypto as collateral.
00:37:32:28 - 00:37:45:29
Tom
And I wonder what can happen to them now. I mean, maybe the answer is they move into, you know, more, know riskier versions of this, or maybe they go, you know, target different geos or something. But, it feels like in some ways this is kind of cannibalistic for for those businesses.
00:37:46:01 - 00:38:07:16
David
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, so really what I'm understanding here is, like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, they are the gatekeepers of what assets are legitimate or not legitimate for mortgages. And then after that, like once we open up the gates for things like Bitcoin, ether like perhaps even more long tail crypto assets to be valid for mortgages, then it kind of goes up to the free market, to the banks, like, all right, banks, what are you guys comfortable with?
00:38:07:18 - 00:38:23:12
David
And so I guess this is where that kind of private public partnership around Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac comes in, like the government says, like no crypto assets are illegitimate. And so even with this, mean maybe, like, I don't know what Fannie Mae Freddie Mac needs to even do in order to, like, make this a new rule.
00:38:23:12 - 00:38:39:04
David
Maybe that's just like, like you said, like a stroke of the pen. And we could just have this good news event show up on Twitter, like next week. Maybe it's that simple. But even after that, then banks start to actually need to be like, okay with it, which I think is, pretty large hurdle in of itself.
00:38:39:07 - 00:38:57:25
Tom
Yeah, that's a good point. And I think we've, we've seen that, even for just, you know, allowing clients to buy Bitcoin or not even the ETFs. And some banks immediately jumped on the opportunity and some have still been slow to sort of adopt. And so, who knows what it's going to look like for mortgage lenders? Maybe again, they'll just be a distribution, on along the risk curve.
00:38:57:27 - 00:39:04:25
Tom
But, I mean, it's still a good step forward, even if this is just the literally the very first baby step in this process.
00:39:04:29 - 00:39:24:26
David
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyways, maybe one day we do have a financial crisis because we have, mortgages, collateral damage for coins. Too much fun. Foreign coin in this system. Tom, there wasn't that much news this week, and I feel like we kind of covered it. So I'm going to bring up just a talking point. Vitalik tweeted out this tweet, which is, retreat of Joseph Lubin.
00:39:24:28 - 00:39:45:11
David
And Joseph Lubin is tweeting out Ethereum layer one will be the master ledger for the world. Vitalik retweets this tweet saying Ethereum layer one L1 is the world ledger to which I retweet. So we're going nesting dolls of of retweeting. And I say subtle change from Ethereum to Ethereum layer one. And I have mixed reviews on this tweet.
00:39:45:11 - 00:40:02:29
David
I have some people being like, bro, these are this is so pedantic. Like this is nothing new. Other people are saying like, oh no. Vitalik Buterin specifying that it's the Ethereum layer, one that is the world ledger and not broad. Ethereum is actually significant. Where do you lie between these two debates?
00:40:03:01 - 00:40:26:26
Tom
I mean, I think it's, I don't know, it's significant, but certainly different than the language that he's used in the past. I still I don't know if this quite communicates the shift, the vibe shift that we've seen in Etherium land of more of a focus on the L1 is almost like by distinguishing the fact that it's the L1 and not an L2 like, you kind of draw attention to this weird and sort of sort of split, which is a big point of the drama in Ethereum land.
00:40:26:26 - 00:40:31:08
Tom
And so why not just call it Ethereum? Why not just call it, you know.
00:40:31:10 - 00:40:35:07
David
When I call it a theorem and mean the layer one, you mean like at the same time?
00:40:35:10 - 00:40:54:12
Tom
Yes. It's almost like when you're when you're overly specific, you're sort of invite more questions, versus you know that the product is what the product is and there's not really any more additional explanation or verbiage required. And so, a little bit weird, but I mean, hey, at least there's some sort of, you know, narrative congealing around, you know, Ethereum L1.
00:40:54:15 - 00:41:13:07
David
Yeah, there this narrative congealing around this theorem, layer one, which I'm a big fan of, and I accept the point that it is really also driving a wedge between the fact that there's this layer one, layer two dynamic, and there are some people in on like one side of the Ethereum. I know that layer twos are Ethereum, they are the same thing as Ethereum.
00:41:13:07 - 00:41:46:14
David
They're part of the system. And then there are other people who are like, no, they are technically not Ethereum. They are technically their own layer twos and naming them under the broad Ethereum umbrella is not helpful and not and not productive and also takes away focus from the Ethereum layer, one that I'm kind of leaning. I've been leaning towards the side more and more and more lately, and I actually think it actually is almost critically important for us to figure this out because Ethereum, the layer one, I think there needs to be a line there as to what is and what is not Ethereum.
00:41:46:14 - 00:42:19:02
David
And in being inclusive of things that I think are truly, actually pretty disparate from Ethereum, like the mostly the rollup landscape that we know today, base world coin world chain like arbitrary which are separate chains that use Ethereum for security. I there should be a separation there. In my opinion. There should be a line there. And when we say Ethereum needs to be the world ledger, people ought to like, like you said, ought to think Ethereum two layer one without having to consider the layer twos and layer twos are just customers of these things are just external protocols.
00:42:19:07 - 00:42:31:26
David
And we need to expand the capacities and the Tam of the Ethereum layer one to the best of its ability, and not have layer two be inclusive of that. I'm on my soapbox right now, but, I wonder, I'm wondering what your take is.
00:42:31:28 - 00:42:50:24
Tom
Yeah, I think probably. Right. I mean, I think a good litmus test is like, what percentage of different L2 users know that they're using a theorem? Or if they're using Ethereum, they know they're selling back to Ethereum. Right. I think there's there's probably a spread there. But like, I think a lot of people on base probably don't think about that.
00:42:50:27 - 00:42:52:21
Tom
You know, they are they're probably and.
00:42:52:24 - 00:42:55:24
David
Interested in growing those numbers, by the way. Yeah.
00:42:55:28 - 00:43:13:16
Tom
I, I'm not saying this, in an accusatory way. I think it is more like, yeah, if you're, you know, using a while as a service, if you're funding through Coinbase smart wallet, if you need your funding to Coinbase and using cash, like, why would you ever think that you're using Ethereum or thinking about where does this transaction actually go?
00:43:13:18 - 00:43:31:00
Tom
You're just thinking, I don't know. I want to go, you know, buy this coin or I want to go coin this song or, you know, whatever, whatever it is that you're actually doing. Which is great. I think that's the way crypto goes mainstream. I think that was a large part of Poly market success, frankly, in the election was you can just sign up and use this thing the same way you would use a web two app.
00:43:31:03 - 00:43:41:29
Tom
But the downside is, you know, if DRM is pitching itself, there's infrastructure and, and plumbing and, that kind of gets lost when, you know, users are, different than what crypto users look like.
00:43:41:29 - 00:43:57:23
David
Today, right? Yeah. There are different cohorts of users, people that kind of understand and pop open the hood and look at the chains that they are touching. And then there are users who are just using apps and they don't care, and they just want to press the buttons, and they don't really give a shit about what blockchain they are on.
00:43:57:23 - 00:44:11:13
David
They just want it to go fast and work. And yeah, the growth of those users, is not going to be found on the Ethereum layer one. If the Ethereum layer one doesn't focus on itself in that, in that same kind of capacity.
00:44:11:15 - 00:44:29:29
Tom
Yeah. I to be clear, I think that's totally fine. I think users should care about a chain being fast and cheap, and I think that is, you know, part of Ethereum's goal is to make this make it the obvious choice, for developers, for users that it just kind of blends in the background, which is something that Solana got right.
00:44:29:29 - 00:44:34:18
Tom
And that's why so many people were choosing it when they were looking to just have some very simple plumbing for their app.
00:44:34:24 - 00:44:51:09
David
Yeah, certainly. Certainly. Yeah, it was a light week. Tom, I really appreciate you coming. Going through the news with me since we have a little bit of extra time. What's exciting to Tom? What are you interested about? You guys have done a couple of, club, order book based exchange episodes on the chopping block. What else is going through your mind?
00:44:51:09 - 00:44:54:00
David
What are you. What are you looking at that no one else is looking at?
00:44:54:02 - 00:45:14:08
Tom
Yeah, we had, Vlad from Leiter. It's a, this, on the on the chopping block this week. Very cool tech that you, verifiable matching and all the orders. So you have to trust, you know, a single party, even for a Dex to match orders together. And so you've got this really nice UX. I was, I my my pet favorite Porthos.
00:45:14:11 - 00:45:19:23
Tom
One that I really am a fan of right now is this company called Mega Pod. They're trying to build the world's largest lottery.
00:45:19:28 - 00:45:22:23
David
No, we, co-investors in mega pot.
00:45:22:25 - 00:45:50:07
Tom
That's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So. Yeah. Very cool. I mean, yeah, already up to $1 million today, for the jackpot. And I think the coolest part is aim. It's it's global. Be it's verifiable. It's on chain. But c users get the beta house. Right. You can you there's a Uniswap style LP mechanism where you can provide liquidity or you can buy a token, and the market sort of sets the rate for, you know, what percent goes back to the house.
00:45:50:07 - 00:45:53:27
Tom
So it's not just, 50%, which is kind of the standard for, for a lottery.
00:45:54:04 - 00:46:16:09
David
Yeah, yeah. And to be clear, this is a normal lottery that you see when you are driving down your highway and you see the mega millions like X billion dollar jackpot, same exact structure, no different except for the fact, as Tom said, that the users also get to be the house. The payoffs are much more fair because I think like the rational dollar going into like a mega millions or something, it's worth $0.22 in terms of like actual EV.
00:46:16:11 - 00:46:34:09
David
Mega pot is something much more close to an actual dollar, $1 and almost $1 out. And then users also get to be the yield on the other side. So like, I think users like the LPs have been earning somewhere between like 22 and 25% AP there's a bunch of mechanics, with how that works.
00:46:34:09 - 00:46:47:29
David
But like any, any time that no one wins the lottery, the LPs just continue to rack up yields and then ticket sales. So it's fun that we get to have both sides of the market benefit. You can be a customer of both. I think that's pretty cool.
00:46:48:01 - 00:47:08:16
Tom
Yeah. It's I mean, I think ultimately you let the market speak and that's how you kind of get innovation. I think it's also, frankly, just cool as basically building an API for for lottery tickets. I mean, it's sort of like straight with a single line. You get to do credit card, check out a single line of code, you can buy a ticket, you can be an LP, you can sell a ticket, you can combine it with other people, all sorts of cool stuff.
00:47:08:16 - 00:47:11:27
Tom
People go on top of it. So, that's a pet favorite for go right now.
00:47:11:28 - 00:47:15:12
David
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Were you, done it permissionless at all this week?
00:47:15:15 - 00:47:22:06
Tom
I was, yeah. Seeing some folks doing couple interviews. Overall, a pretty good vibe other than the fact that it was like a hundred degrees in York.
00:47:22:08 - 00:47:23:23
David
Yeah. And sad.
00:47:23:25 - 00:47:26:09

Definitely the permissionless attendance was actually pretty good as far I was concerned that, attendance for permissionless was going to be down because it was in New York, because New York is such a, there's a magnet for side events there. But, man, people love going to the actual conference. And, and, I mean, this is what happens when podcasters, I think, organize, panels, it's like, it's actually like good and worth, interesting and worth going.
00:47:49:11 - 00:48:03:12
David
And also, block works. Is it a killer job just organizing, in Industry City? There was like a zero ex research dunk tank. So all the Xerox research boys were getting dunked, which is pretty fun. And overall, yeah, the vibes were like pretty good and upbeat. And everyone was there. Yeah.
00:48:03:14 - 00:48:07:08
Tom
Yeah. Going to give a shout out to the Block Works crew for organizing another great permissionless.
00:48:07:14 - 00:48:15:17
David
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tom, you are a podcaster. If people liked your takes and like the sound of your voice, where can they go? Hear you.
00:48:15:19 - 00:48:30:03
Tom
They can find me on Twitter. I'm Tom H. Schmidt, MD. Or you can check out the chopping block or underscore chopping block on Twitter. And yeah, you check out dragonfly or, see me online, and you know me already. But thanks for having me on on your pod. It was great.
00:48:30:09 - 00:48:43:15
David
Yeah, I really appreciate it, my man. There's a ton of fun. Thank you. You guys know the deal. Crypto is risky. You can lose what you put in, especially if you put it into a lottery. That's half of the point. Nonetheless, this is a frontier. We are glad you're with us on the bank list or any. Thanks a lot.

6. Who’s winning the West’s crypto regulation race?
📖 Summary: While the European Union and United Kingdom push forward with cautious crypto frameworks, the United States is suddenly emerging as a front-runner in global digital asset policy thanks to a blitz of legislation, political momentum and massive ETF inflows.
In the latest episode of Byte-Sized Insight, Cointelegraph head of podcasts Savannah Fortis is joined by Mark Jennings, head of Europe at Gemini, to break down how the US, EU and UK are approaching crypto regulation and what it means for innovation, adoption and investment across the West.
“We’ve seen the administration push legislation very quickly as it’s come in this year,” said Jennings. “It became a topic of conversation during the presidential election, and I think it highlights the importance of crypto globally, that it becomes a talking point at that level.”
The US still has a way to go before getting some important bills set in stone. Additionally, it may also face regulatory fragmentation at the state level, similar to the situation in Europe, where 30 national regulators are now tasked with implementing the EU’s MiCA regulation.
MiCA, adopted in 2023, is widely considered the world’s most comprehensive crypto regulatory framework. “Where we get to now with MiCA, it’s built a full infrastructure that views cryptocurrency as another asset class,” Jennings said.

Meanwhile, the UK’s post-Brexit approach is lagging. Though it recently lifted a ban on crypto ETNs, a full regulatory framework remains a work in progress. Jennings said the country is taking a more deliberate route.
“I think the UK has taken a wait-and-see approach,” he said.
Still, Jennings cautions that innovation moves fast and regulators need to keep pace. “Sometimes you’ve got to wait and see… but also see what happens in other jurisdictions and maybe be somewhat reactive and somewhat proactive,” he said.

7. Binance taps ex-Gemini exec Gillian Lynch to reboot Europe push
📖 Summary: Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has appointed Gillian Lynch as its new head of Europe and the United Kingdom, signaling a renewed push to secure regulatory approval across the region.
Lynch brings more than 20 years of leadership experience in fintech, banking and digital assets. She previously held senior roles at Gemini, Bank of Ireland and Leveris.
The appointment, announced Friday, comes as Binance faces increasing scrutiny in Europe and seeks to align with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). Lynch will oversee Binance’s regional strategy, day-to-day operations and regulatory engagements across key European and UK markets.
The hire signals Binance’s “long-term commitment to thoughtful regulation, user protection, and sustainable growth in the region,” the announcement states.
The new appointment comes over four years after the former head of Binance UK, Jonathan Farnell, stepped down from his role at the exchange in May 2021.

Richard Teng, CEO of Binance, said Lynch’s regulatory and compliance expertise will help guide the exchange through a critical period for the industry:

New global regulatory standards like MiCA are enabling the crypto industry to enter a new era of global legitimacy, according to Lynch.
“I’m looking forward to building on the company’s momentum across Europe and the UK, collaborating closely with regulators, policymakers, and our community,” said Lynch in the announcement.
When asked about the company’s updated MiCA compliance strategy, a Binance spokesperson told Cointelegraph, “We’re committed to ongoing compliance with the requirements of MiCA, but we won’t be disclosing details of our strategy.”
The spokesperson also said there are “no changes to Binance’s board structure.”
In June 2023, Binance canceled its registration with the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Later that month, Binance terminated its services in the Netherlands, exiting the Dutch market after failing to obtain a virtual asset service provider (VASP) license.
MiCA went into full effect for crypto-asset service providers on Dec. 30, 2024, with an 18-month transitional period that ends on July 1, 2026. This enables crypto service providers who operate in accordance with national applicable laws to continue operating until the deadline, or until they are granted or refused a MiCA authorization.
Cointelegraph contacted Gemini for comment but had not received a response by publication.
Under Lynch’s leadership as Europe CEO, Gemini became the first company to be registered as a VASP by the Central Bank of Ireland, the company announced in July 2022.
It is unclear whether Lynch is subject to a non-compete agreement with Gemini. Under a non-compete agreement, an employee agrees not to directly compete with the company for a pre-determined period after the employment period ends.

8. Here’s what happened in crypto today
📖 Summary: Today in crypto, a Belgian court has sentenced three people for their roles in a cryptocurrency-related kidnapping, US Republican House leaders have designated July 14 to July 18 as “Crypto Week,” focusing on considering three key crypto bills, and a new US Senate bill aims to overhaul crypto taxation.
A Belgian court has sentenced three people for their roles in a cryptocurrency-related kidnapping targeting the wife of local crypto entrepreneur Stéphane Winkel.
The Brussels Criminal Court handed down 12-year prison sentences to three kidnappers who attacked Winkel’s wife in December 2024, local news agency La Dernière Heure reported on Thursday.
The criminals were convicted of hostage-taking after abducting the victim outside her home, forcing her into a van and demanding a ransom in cryptocurrency.
Alerted by Winkel, law enforcement pursued the van and subsequently arrested the kidnappers and freed the victim after taking the vehicle off the road with a risky maneuver.
In addition to the prison sentences, the court ordered the three convicted kidnappers to pay at least 1 million euros ($1.2 million) in civil damages to the victim.
While holding the trio accountable, the court acknowledged that the masterminds behind the kidnapping remain unidentified. It also rejected the defendants’ claims that they were coerced into the crime under threat of death.
According to the report, the case also involves a minor, who is being handled separately by a juvenile court.
US Republican House leaders have pledged to consider three key crypto bills starting in mid-July as part of a regulatory “Crypto Week.”
House Finance Committee Chair French Hill, House Agriculture Committee Chair Glenn Thompson and Speaker Mike Johnson said on Thursday that they’d use the week of July 14 to 18 to look over a crypto market structure bill, a stablecoin bill and a bill on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).
“House Republicans are taking decisive steps to deliver the full scope of President Trump’s digital assets and cryptocurrency agenda,” Johnson said.
“During ‘Crypto Week,’ the House looks forward to the timely consideration of three landmark pieces of legislation: the CLARITY Act, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, and the Senate’s GENIUS Act,” he added.
The party’s push comes as President Donald Trump said last month that he wants the stablecoin-regulating GENIUS Act passed as soon as possible, before Congress goes on a month-long break in August.
The bills would begin to deliver on Trump’s crypto-focused promises during his campaign, which the crypto industry heavily backed and bankrolled.
US Senator Cynthia Lummis submitted a draft bill on Thursday, outlining several provisions to overhaul the tax code and exempt certain digital asset transactions from taxation after crypto amendments failed to appear in the budget package.
The bill proposes a de minimis exemption for digital asset transactions and capital gains of $300 or less, with a $5,000 annual exemption cap.
The Wyoming Senator also outlined provisions to exempt crypto lending agreements and digital assets used in charitable contributions from taxation. Additionally, the bill proposed deferring taxes on mining and staking rewards until the underlying assets are sold. Lummis said:
My legislation ensures Americans can participate in the digital economy without inadvertent tax violations,” she continued.
The standalone draft bill is now the Wyoming Senator's best chance of passing the pro-crypto legislation promised to the crypto community after Senators passed the spending bill without addressing digital assets.

9. Solana bot scam on GitHub steals crypto from users
📖 Summary: A GitHub repository posing as a legitimate Solana trading bot has been exposed for reportedly hiding crypto-stealing malware.
According to a Friday report by blockchain security firm SlowMist, the now-deleted solana-pumpfun-bot repository hosted by account “zldp2002” mimicked a real open-source tool to harvest user credentials. SlowMist reportedly launched the investigation after a user found that their funds had been stolen on Thursday.
The malicious GitHub repository in question featured “a relatively high number of stars and forks,” SlowMist said. All code commits across all its directories were made about three weeks ago, with apparent irregularities and a lack of consistent pattern that, according to SlowMist, would indicate a legitimate project.
The project is Node.js-based and leverages the third-party package crypto-layout-utils as a dependency. “Upon further inspection, we found that this package had already been removed from the official NPM registry,” SlowMist said.

The package could no longer be downloaded from the official node package manager (NPM) registry, prompting investigators to question how the victim had downloaded the package. Investigating further, SlowMist discovered that the attacker was downloading the library from a separate GitHub repository.
After analyzing the package, SlowMist researchers found it to be heavily obfuscated using jsjiami.com.v7, making analysis harder. After de-obfuscation, investigators confirmed that it was a malicious package that scans local files, and if it detects wallet-related content or private keys, it would upload them to a remote server.
Related: North Korean hackers targeting crypto projects with unusual Mac exploit
Further investigation by SlowMist revealed that the attacker likely controlled a batch of GitHub accounts. These accounts were used to fork projects into malicious variations, distributing malware while artificially inflating fork and star counts.
Multiple forked repositories exhibited similar features, with some versions incorporating another malicious package, bs58-encrypt-utils-1.0.3. This package was created on June 12, which is when SlowMist researchers said they believed the attacker began distributing malicious NPM modules and Node.js projects.
The incident is the latest in a string of software supply chain attacks targeting crypto users. In recent weeks, similar schemes have targeted Firefox users with fake wallet extensions and used GitHub repositories to host credential-stealing code.

10. FTX estate asks court to freeze payouts in ‘restricted’ countries
📖 Summary: FTX’s bankruptcy estate has raised concerns over payouts to creditors in countries with ambiguous or restrictive cryptocurrency regulations.
On Wednesday, the FTX estate filed a motion with the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, seeking authorization for the FTX Recovery Trust to freeze distributions to creditors in “potentially restricted foreign jurisdictions.”
The jurisdictions — 49 countries in total — have unclear or restrictive crypto laws, potentially posing risks due to complex cross-border legal implications.
“Distributions made by or on behalf of the FTX Recovery Trust into jurisdictions in violation of these legal restrictions may trigger fines and penalties, including personal liability for directors and officers, and/or criminal penalties up to and including imprisonment,” the filing reads.
With FTX creditors located around the world, the bankruptcy estate is taking steps to ensure compliance with local laws in each jurisdiction before issuing cryptocurrency distributions.
Although regulations vary across the 49 identified countries, they generally prohibit individuals or entities from engaging in any activities related to digital assets, including crypto trading or distributing crypto-related proceeds to residents within those jurisdictions, the estate stated.
“For example, in Macau, ‘financial institutions and non-bank payment institutions are prohibited explicitly by mainland authorities from providing services for these tokens and virtual currencies,” it stated.
It added that all listed countries are subject to similar restrictions, referring to jurisdictions like China, Egypt, Iran, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine and others.
While highlighting the potentially restricted jurisdictions for distributions, the FTX estate is not blocking the payouts to the mentioned countries entirely.
Instead, it said that the recovery trust is holding the distributions pending resolution and is ready to clear some of them as the process progresses.
According to the FTX estate, China accounts for 82% of the value of affected asserted claims among the total number of potentially restricted foreign jurisdictions.
Mainland China remains one of the most contentious jurisdictions regarding cryptocurrency, as regulators have repeatedly banned crypto transactions but have not explicitly prohibited individuals from holding digital assets.
Neighboring jurisdictions like Hong Kong have taken a pro-crypto stance, greenlighting crypto investment products like derivatives and exchange-traded funds.

“To provide clarity to the FTX Recovery Trust and its stakeholders alike, the FTX Recovery Trust has developed the restricted jurisdiction procedures to provide notice and a process for resolving the question of whether distributions will be made pursuant to the plan,” the estate said, adding:
Although some in the community have expressed outrage over FTX estate’s approach to potentially restricted countries for distributions, others suggested that its stance is reasonable.
“When it comes to token distributions in bankruptcy, there is still significant legal uncertainty, and it doesn’t surprise me that the FTX estate might not make distributions in countries where such distributions might be illegal,” Aaron Brogan, founder and managing attorney at Brogan Law, told Cointelegraph.
